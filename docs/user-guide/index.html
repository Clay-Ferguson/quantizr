<h2 id="hierarchical-cms"><a href="#hierarchical-cms" id="hierarchical-cms">Hierarchical CMS</a></h2>
<p>Quanta is a web-based CMS (Content Management System) for creating, editing, and sharing hierarchical content, with features similar to Wikis, and Social Media platforms.</p>
<p>Create hierarchically organized content that's editable like a document, blog, or wiki, and structured like a tree, or a file system. You can navigate and explore the content by browsing this tree, posting nodes onto it, searching it, sharing branches of it, viewing timelines, etc.</p>
<p>Quanta uses the <code>&quot;block editor&quot; approach</code> to document editing, which means individual blocks of content (called <code>Nodes</code>) make up all of the data. Platforms using block editors are becoming very popular, and include for example:  Notion, Jupyter Notebooks, and WordPress Gutenberg.</p>

<div id='62265ff1990f3a11b5c4f7ca'></div>
<p>To allow a fine-grained hierarchical approach to content organization, the platform <code>&quot;quantizes&quot;</code> each piece of information into <code>Tree Nodes</code> (thus the name <code>&quot;Quanta&quot;</code>).</p>
<p>Node content can be as small as one sentence (like a tweet), or as large as you want, having multiple paragraphs of text. Each node can also have file attachments (images, videos, etc.) Depending on context, sometimes the word <code>Folder</code> is used and sometimes the word <code>Node</code> is used, but the important thing to know is that each Node (piece of content) can contain other Nodes, so in this way content nodes are similar to file system <code>Folders</code>, and are also Tree-like.</p>
<div id='63ed5d7232831373361c303b'></div>
<p>With these small chunks of content you can create nodes that are Social Media posts (free-standing content without any prior context); but you can also organize content into larger structures to compose a document, blog, or other long-form content, with different sections, chapters, headings, etc. containing the individual sentences and paragraphs of the document.</p>
<div id='6324d3a526b99d23a1c730c2'></div>
<p>Since everyone is familiar with files and folders in the context of a computer operating system, the main thing to remember is that Quanta uses the terms tree, branch, or even subgraph to refer to what you already know as &quot;Folders&quot;.</p>
<p>So if you realize a folder structure on computers is a &quot;Tree&quot; then everything else about the Quanta terminology should be intuitive and obvious to you. The term &quot;Node&quot; just means &quot;something on the tree&quot;.</p>
<div id='5fa1926b6b842575d0e9259f'></div>
<p>All nodes can contain any number of subnodes (which is what makes Quanta a <code>tree</code>). This means Quanta is &quot;browsable&quot; like a file system, but instead of seeing file names and folder names (like a file-manager), you see the actual content text and images, displayed inline on the page.</p>
<div id='5fa1926c6b842575d0e925a0'></div>
<p>Similar to how Twitter has <code>Tweets</code>, Facebook has <code>Posts</code>, Jupyter Notebooks has <code>cells</code>, etc., Quanta has a fundamental piece of content called a <code>Node</code>. These nodes make up hierarchies of content so, to repeat the above, they can represent Documents (a tree structure of paragraphs), Wikis, Social Media posts, blogs, or anything else. There's no distinction between those use cases.</p>
<p>Each user owns one branch of the tree (their account root node, and whatever you've created under it).</p>
<div id='656f82a691e61b699d8329b4'></div>
<p>The final important thing to realize about Nodes is that in general the way you reply to a piece of content is by creating a subnode under the node you're replying to. So this means when multiple people are creating content collaboratively it automatically becomes the logical equivalent of a &quot;Social Media Thread&quot;, and in Quanta these threads are therefore hierarchical. However, unlike a <code>chat room</code> there's never any confusion about what any post is a reply to because the parent node is understood to be that.</p>

<div id='6113f5a92ef5fd09501e2213'></div>
<p>Each node automatically has its own unique URL, and can be shared with others or kept private. You can also (optionally) enter a name on any node to make it available by a more user-friendly URL, that uses the name you give it instead of the default numerical identifier (Record ID).</p>
<p>For example, below is an example URL for a node owned by user 'bob' that's named 'blog'. By naming the node 'blog' (done in the Node Editor) and making the node 'public' this URL is automatically accessible by everyone, as a web page at the following URL:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://domain.com/u/bob/blog">https://domain.com/u/bob/blog</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-new-collaboration-model"><a href="#a-new-collaboration-model" id="a-new-collaboration-model">A New Collaboration Model</a></h2>
<div id='6113f7132ef5fd09501e221a'></div>
<p>The hierarchical structure is powerful for organizing data and documents, but is also what enables ad-hoc discussion threads to form under any node in the content. When collaborating on a document, for example, any piece of content can have arbitrarily large discussion threads branching off underneath it.</p>
<div id='61142c392ef5fd09501e8c04'></div>
<p>In many ways, this type of collaboration architecture (i.e. tree-based) is preferable to the old-school 'revision marks' used by conventional monolithic document editors (like Microsoft Office 365).</p>
<p>Not only can multiple people suggest revisions to any given sentence, but there can be an entire team discussion happening under any sentence or paragraph in a document, without interrupting the flow of the document itself.</p>
<p>This method of collaboration also eliminates the need for sending emails back and forth when some specifics of a document need to be discussed. Document changes can be discussed right inside the document itself, right at the location of the proposed change!</p>
<div id='5fa1926c6b842575d0e925a1'></div>
<p>To expand on this <code>hierarchical threading model</code> a bit more: A branch of the tree <em>is considered</em> a conversation thread (by definition), if it contains a chain of replies to nodes.</p>
<p>In other words, the way you <code>reply</code> to a post (or node) is by creating a subnode directly under it. The general understanding is that if you create a node under someone else's node, then you're saying something in reference to the parent node.</p>
<p>So there's no need for a concept like &quot;creating a new thread&quot; (like the awkward way Discord and many other platforms have attempted to solve what is undeniably a need for hierarchical content), because everything in Quanta is always essentially a thread already, because everything is a branch of a tree.</p>
<p>The key point here: <code>All Conversation Threads are Trees</code></p>
<div id='60368d4c80c75f22b25fd3ee'></div>
<p>You may have also used the &quot;Quote in Reply&quot; feature of Discord or other platforms where you're in a large chat room, wanting to reply to some specific post. Have you noticed how that's very awkward in a room with multiple simultaneous conversations happening at the same time? When everyone has to re-quote what they're replying to, the whole chat room becomes chaotic and cluttered. Also you have to constantly enter someone's name in every reply or else your message won't have proper context, and no one can tell who you're even replying to, without all this additional effort and duplication of text.</p>
<p><code>Quanta elegantly solves *all* of this chaos</code>, by being a tree at the fundamental level: There's never any question about what a node is a <code>reply to</code> because that is always its <code>parent</code> node!</p>
<p>The more conventional Timeline view is still always just one click away to display the Rev-Chron view of any tree branch whenever you <em>do</em> want a merged list of everything said by everyone (under some subgraph of the tree), all merged together into a single list.</p>
<div id='61114adb2ef5fd09501a3402'></div>
<p>If you're thinking it sounds awkward to have to expand any node to see what's under it, that's because you do need to know <em>how</em> to use <code>Timelines</code> and also the <code>Document View</code>.</p>
<p>The &quot;Timeline&quot; button (clock icon, at top of Folders Tab) can be used to instantly see the more 'standard' reverse-chronological view under that node (like how Twitter or Mastodon would display it).</p>
<p>Knowing how to seamlessly jump back and forth between the <code>Folders Tab</code> (a Tree View) and the <code>Timeline Tab</code> (a Rev-Chron View) is the key to being able to use the platform effectively and is a necessary learning curve to unlock the real power and convenience of the platform.</p>
<div id='5fac189ac2317b6f53ac3d54'></div>
<p>As remote work (i.e. &quot;Working from Home&quot;) becomes the norm for many tech companies, Quanta offers a uniquely powerful way to collaborate on <code>Deep Documents</code> uniquely better and easier than what other team collaboration systems provide.</p>
<div id='63ed618832831373361c319d'></div>
<p><code>Deep Documents</code> is a term that means documents which are structured content of arbitrary tree-depth, and are hierarchical, and can therefore potentially contain discussion threads like described above.</p>
<div id='63ed618832831373361c319e'></div>
<p>Importantly, these kinds of Deep Documents can also be powerful for their ability to preserve the thought processes, and discussions from all contributors, that led up to the final version of a document. This is obviously great for better accountability of decision making and for future reference regarding why a collaborative document ended up as it did.</p>

<p>The Folders tab is where you can view all the content nodes. As shown in the animated GIF below you can explore the tree by expanding sections one at a time, or you can also request a Document View at any time for a more document-centric experience if you prefer that.</p>

<p>The most important things to learn first:</p>
<div id='63f2c99055770e1b97de0b26'></div>
<ul>
<li>The blue buttons with <code>Folder Icons</code> (labelled 'Open' and 'Up') let you go deeper into the tree or come back out.</li>
</ul>
<div id='63f2c99055770e1b97de0b27'></div>
<ul>
<li>Below the <code>Page Root Node</code> (Top of page when you're on the <code>Folders Tab</code>) are the children of that node, which makes up what your page will display, when you're on the Folders Tab.</li>
</ul>
<div id='63f2c99055770e1b97de0b28'></div>
<ul>
<li>Turn <code>Menu -&gt; Options -&gt; Edit Mode and/or Node Info</code> options on only when you need them, so the page is cleaner looking. The page will render with lots more info and buttons when you enable those.</li>
</ul>
<figure>

<div id='63f2c99055770e1b97de0b29'></div>
<ul>
<li>The top-level sections on the right of the page are called <code>&quot;Tabs&quot; (or Views)</code>, and you can only be viewing one at a time. Whatever tab you're on determines what you see in the center panel of the app.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the screenshot below the <code>Folders Tab</code> is selected. Think of the &quot;Folders Tab&quot; as your &quot;Tree View&quot; of the database. All Quanta data is stored hierarchically like a file system, and the Folders Tab is how you can interact with that hierarchy.</p>

<p>This will show all the parent nodes, of the selected node, going all the way up on the tree and display them all in order of creation. For example if this node is part of a conversation, it will show the entire &quot;context&quot; of the discussion which will consist of every part of the discussion that led up to the node itself.</p>

<h3 id="document-view"><a href="#document-view" id="document-view">Document View</a></h3>
<p>The normal behavior of Quanta (i.e. the Folders view) is to display one level of the tree at a time, and requires you to expand nodes to navigate to various pieces of content. So the Document View is a way to display everything under a node all at once. It's called &quot;Document&quot; view because you're essentially displaying a tree branch formatted as a conventional monolithic document.</p>

<div id='66aff8cc85296c2da907720d'></div>
<p>When you put a url in any node the system will by default display it using a small image and snippet of text from the website if the website supports that kind of thing. For example if you put a youtube url in some content the GUI will display the image and title and description of that video at the bottom of the node.</p>
<p>If you want to display the URL all by itself without that preview content just prefix the url with an asterisk followed by a space on a separate line like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-md"> * https://somesite.com
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to display just the preview image and text and not the URL itself use this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-md"> - https://somesite.com

<p>Or this, to show the preview image but neither a long description nor the URL.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Here's what the above example is like you can see how it works:</p>
<p>-<strong>Collapsible Heading</strong>-</p>
<p>This is the text that was hidden until you clicked the Collapsible Heading</p>
<p>To designate the end of the collapsible section put two blank lines in the text, to separate your collapsible section from any content that may come below it.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's handy to be able to enter private text/notes into a node that's visible to you (the owner of the node) and no one else, even if/when the node is shard publicly. To do this, put your private notes inside an HTML Comment block right in the markdown which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">This text will be visible to everyone

&lt;!-- This text will be visible only to the owner of the node. --&gt;

<div id='63ed9f4a32831373361c46b7'></div>
<p>When <code>Edit Mode</code> is enabled you'll see a checkbox to the left of each node that you can use to select to Cut-and-Paste or Delete.</p>
<p>If you want to rapidly un-check all checkbox selections, use <code>Menu -&gt; Edit -&gt; Clear Selections</code></p>
<div id='5fa1926c6b842575d0e925de'></div>
<h3 id="delete"><a href="#delete" id="delete">Delete</a></h3>

<h3 id="split-node"><a href="#split-node" id="split-node">Split Node</a></h3>
<p>When editing a node it's common to end up with multiple paragraphs of text on a single node that you end up deciding you want saved as multiple <em>individual</em> nodes instead. This is easy to fix using the 'Split Node' feature.</p>
<div id='63edbb714975b001996fac99'></div>
<p>Here's the dialog you'll see pop up when you save some text that has double spaced content, which does this for you:</p>
<figure>

<div id='5fa1926c6b842575d0e925e1'></div>
<p>Nodes can be automatically split apart, in two ways:</p>
<h4 id="split-inline"><a href="#split-inline" id="split-inline">Split Inline</a></h4>
<p>Splits up the selected node into multiple nodes at the same level (under same parent) by using places where text is double-spaced as the delimiter (or divider) where things should be broken apart.</p>
<h4 id="split-into-children"><a href="#split-into-children" id="split-into-children">Split into Children</a></h4>
<p>Performs the same kind of transformation as 'Split Inline' except it leaves the first chunk of text where it is, and then makes all the other chunks become children under that.</p>
<div id='64e57b8a0d3d9d7b99ea2f55'></div>
<p>To split a node, first select the node (by clicking on it) and then choose <code>Menu -&gt; Edit -&gt; Split</code>. You'll see a dialog like in the image below.</p>
<p>In the dialog you specify what the delimiter to split on is, as well is whether you want to keep all the nodes at the same level of the tree (inline) or whether you want the nodes split up and appended as <strong>children</strong> of the node you're splitting.</p>
<figure>

<h3 id="join-nodes"><a href="#join-nodes" id="join-nodes">Join Nodes</a></h3>
<p>This does the reverse of <code>Split Node</code>. This function combines multiple nodes into one node, by merging the content of all selected nodes into one block of text in one node.</p>
<p>To join nodes first select (via check boxes) all the nodes you want to join, and then click <code>Menu -&gt; Edit -&gt; Join</code>. This will append to the first node the content from all the other nodes, and then delete those other nodes. So this means all the selected nodes get merged into the first selected node.</p>
<p>NOTE: If any of the nodes being joined have attachments those attachments will also end up being added to the 'joined' node.</p>

<h2 id="set-headings"><a href="#set-headings" id="set-headings">Set Headings</a></h2>
<div id='63eda1d632831373361c47a9'></div>
<p>Using <code>Menu -&gt; Edit -&gt; Set Headings</code> you can automatically update the markdown heading levels in all content under the selected node.</p>
<p>For example, if your selected node starts with <code>## My Heading</code> that would be a markdown heading level of &quot;2&quot; (two hash marks), so running <code>Set Headings</code> (when you have that node selected) would update the entire content tree heading levels below that, so direct children's headings would be level 3 (###), and below them level 4 (####) etc. for all contained hierarchical levels of content.</p>

<div id='5f1795da33fee84d9aa76243'></div>
<p>Every node has a 'type', which allows the system to customize the editing and visual presentation. Normally you can just ignore node types, because the 'Markdown Type' is used automatically by default.</p>
<p>The most common exception to this is that the 'reply button' does automatically create a &quot;Reply Type&quot; node, that behaves like a markdown node but that the system can use to filter out or include &quot;reply content&quot; as desired by the user, and to be able to distinguish &quot;main content&quot; from &quot;commentary&quot; on large documents.</p>

<h2 id="transfers"><a href="#transfers" id="transfers">Transfers</a></h2>
<p>You can transfer nodes you own to a different user, so they can edit them directly, and then potentially transfer them back to you, or to someone else. A node Transfer doesn't change the location of the nodes, or alter their content in any way other than to change the node's owner.</p>
<div id='5fa1926c6b842575d0e925e2'></div>
<p><em>Note: Node Transfers is currently an 'admin-only' function</em></p>
<p>Every node is by default 'owned' by the person who created it. The Transfer feature allows you to transfer one or more nodes from one user to another. In the Transfer Dialog you're prompted to enter (optionally) a &quot;From&quot; user name, and required to enter the &quot;To&quot; user name.</p>
<p>The transfer will (optionally) scan all the subnodes in the entire subgraph under the selected node and all nodes owned by the &quot;From&quot; user will be transferred to the new &quot;To&quot; user.</p>
<p>If you leave the &quot;From&quot; field blank, then <em>all</em> nodes in the subgraph regardless of current owner, will be transferred to the &quot;To&quot; user.</p>
<div id='635dde9668a8d0147326ac09'></div>
<p>Quanta uses a collaboration model where content is encouraged to be broken down into small sized chunks like single sentences or paragraphs. So there's  almost never a need for anyone to directly edit any actual content that was authored by someone else.</p>
<div id='635ddf1068a8d0147326ac32'></div>
<p>The way users normally comment on (or suggest changes to) other people's content is by doing a &quot;Reply&quot; directly under the node being commented on. However, you can transfer one or more nodes (that you own) to some other user of your choice, in the event that it is required for them to edit the content directly.</p>
<div id='635de23c68a8d0147326ad4e'></div>
<p>To initiate a transfer, select a node that you own (by clicking it in the Tree View) and then select <code>Menu -&gt; Transfer -&gt; Transfer</code>.</p>
<p>This will open a dialog like the one below, where you'll enter the usernames of the two persons involved in the transfer.</p>

<div id='635de40368a8d0147326adec'></div>
<p>In the dialog above you can select <code>Include Subnodes</code> if you'd like to transfer <em>all</em> subnodes that you own under the subgraph to the other person. If there are also subnodes under that branch of the tree that you don't own, then of course none of those nodes will be transferred. Only nodes owned by the &quot;From&quot; user will get transferred.</p>

<h3 id="about-admin-transfers"><a href="#about-admin-transfers" id="about-admin-transfers">About Admin Transfers</a></h3>
<p>If you're the admin and you open the Transfer dialog you'll have the option of specifying the &quot;Transfer From&quot; user name as well as the &quot;Transfer To&quot; user name. This means the admin can initiate a transfer from any arbitrary person to any other arbitrary person.</p>
<p>However even if the admin initiates the transfer in this way, the person on the receiving end of the transfer can still reject the transfer, and the nodes will revert back to being owned by previous owner.</p>

<p>When you create a node you're automatically set as the 'owner' of the node, and by default if you don't mention any other usernames in the text (or add shares in the Sharing Dialog) then the node will be private to you and only visible to you.</p>
<p>However, any node can be shared with specific other users, or made public to everyone by adding Shares to the node.</p>

<figure>

<p>In addition to making this node public, let's share it to a couple of people. After clicking <code>Add People</code> in the dialog above we will be presented with our Friends List Dialog, for picking people, as shown below:</p>
<figure>

<p>After using the checkboxes in the above list of friends to pick Jetson and Adam, and clicking <code>Ok</code> (on the dialog above), we end up back at the Sharing Dialog and again it's showing the list of who it's shared to (see below).</p>

<p>Now the Node Editor is showing us that the node is public and also shared to two specific people.</p>

<p>We could still go back and alter the sharing any time we want, by going back into the Sharing Dialog again. So for example if we decide we don't want the node public we can just delete the &quot;Public&quot; entry, and then only adam and jetson would be able to see the node.</p>

<h2 id="unpublished-option"><a href="#unpublished-option" id="unpublished-option">Unpublished Option</a></h2>
<p>This is handy when you're working on a document you've shared as public already and don't want each and every paragraph edit you do to get broadcast out to everyone's feeds.</p>
<p>For nodes that are &quot;Unpublished&quot; they're still visible to people you've shared them to, but they have to specifically navigate to the node to see it.</p>
<p>The 'Unpublished' option doesn't make the node private at all, because as long as you've got sharing set on this node the people shared with <em>can</em> still see it; but what the &quot;Unpublished&quot; option will do is to stop broadcasting the real-time changes you make going forward.</p>

<div id='672aa11aa2c28443680032d6'></div>
<p>As you saw in the previous section on node Sharing, there was a &quot;Website&quot; checkbox on the sharing dialog that's available any time you've made the node public. Shown here:</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_672aa11aa2c28443680032d6_p' src='attachments/672aa11aa2c28443680032d6_p.png'  />
<figcaption>Fig. 29</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='672aa1bca2c28443680032d9'></div>
<p>Once you've set the &quot;Website&quot; option on the dialog, the entire public contents under the node will become a live website hosted at a URL path like <code>/pub/[user_name]/[node_name]</code> or <code>/pub/[node_id]</code>. All nodes have a <code>node id</code> automatically, but it's up to you to assign a <code>node name</code> if you want to create a more friendly looking URL like for example <code>https://domain.com/pub/clay/my_page</code>.</p>
<div id='672aa4bea2c28443680032e4'></div>
<p>An example of a Website that's published in this way is the Quanta User Guide itself, which you are now reading, if you're at the following url:</p>
<p><code>https://clay-ferguson.github.io/quantizr/user-guide/</code></p>
<p>Here's what the rendered Websites look like (image below). There's always a 'Table of Contents' on the left hand side, which is built from the Markdown headings. Since the Table of Contents and the Document part (right hand side) are in the same HTML file, the page loads are super fast, and all-inclusive.</p>
<figure>

<p>By unselecting the Website checkbox, or removing the public sharing, the website will become unavailable again (i.e. taken offline). Once you publish the website for the first time, it will be generated and cached on the server, for extremely fast access by users. This is also nice because it means while you're editing your next revision of your website you can do so privately without your edits being published until you're ready to republish. You can republish the site by clicking the <code>Build Website</code> button which will be showing up on the Node Editor dialog, as shown here:</p>

<p>You can also download an archive file that contains all the files for the website which consists of the entire HTML file as one file, plus all the images in a separate older in the folder structure of the archive file.</p>
<p>The only other tiny files in the export will be two called <code>prism.js</code> and <code>prism.css</code> which are optional and not even needed unless there are code blocks in your Markdown that need to be nicely formatted.</p>

<h2 id="about-publishing"><a href="#about-publishing" id="about-publishing">About Publishing</a></h2>
<p>The primary purpose of Publishing a Website in this way is to create something that's extremely fast loading and perfectly packages up a specific branch of your tree that you intend to have consumed as a website/document.</p>
<p>Published websites load lightning fast because there's no application javascript at all, but only one big HTML file. For cases where you want users to have advanced features like the ability to &quot;reply&quot; to nodes (as in a Social Media or Wiki kind of use case), or search, sort, etc. then of course all you'd do is make the node Public and there'd be no need to generate this static website.</p>

<h2 id="hierarchical-websites"><a href="#hierarchical-websites" id="hierarchical-websites">Hierarchical Websites</a></h2>
<p>For more complex websites where you don't want the whole thing rendered as a single big document you can include a website inside another website, using the exact same instructions as above. This all works automatically and when you define one website inside another one, the containing website will automatically generate a link to the contained website, so that you have a multi-page website with automatically provided navigation across all pages.</p>

<div id='673e3c9af0c42c7fc61e427d'></div>
<p>In any generated HTML of websites (and also in Exported HTML or PDF) images are automatically numbered with a Figure number like <code>Fig. 1</code> <code>Fig. 2</code> etc.</p>
<p>For a consistent way to mention (i.e. refer to) specific figures in the content text you need to use the following syntax to be sure they're always correct whenever the figures are renumbered:</p>
<p>To be able to refer to an image on a node you need to be sure to assign the node a name in the Node Editor. The Editor will automatically detect and disallow duplicate node names, so you don't have to keep close track of node names yourself, or keep a list of them anywhere.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a node named <code>file-uploads</code> with a couple of image attachments to it.</p>
<p>You could put the following in your content text to refer to those images:</p>
<pre><code>{{figure:file-uploads}} or {{figure:file-uploads,1}}

{{figure:file-uploads,2}}
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever the website is generated (or an export of HTML or PDF is done) those things will be replaced with something like <code>Fig. 42</code> and <code>Fig. 43</code> (where the 42 or 43 will be different of course), and will correctly reference the two images on the node named <code>file-uploads</code>.</p>

<p>Since AI is provided by 3rd party Cloud LLM Providers, and their services cost money, Quanta lets you use your own credit, which you can add to you account, by going to <code>Menu -&gt; Account -&gt; Settings -&gt; Add Credit</code> to use your Credit Card to add funds directly to your own account. Add as much credit as you want, but even one $1 buys quite a lot of AI generated content, so add as little or as much funds to your account as you want.

<h2 id="ai-modes"><a href="#ai-modes" id="ai-modes">AI Modes</a></h2>
<div id='66e3232eb49c9e3c9edb6c63'></div>
<p>There are 3 AI <code>Modes</code>. Each mode slightly changes how the app works, to make it easier to focus on doing whichever kind of AI work you're doing at the time. You can set the mode using <code>Menu -&gt; AI -&gt; Writing Mode</code> (for example)</p>
<div id='66e32399b49c9e3c9edb6c64'></div>
<h3 id="chat-mode"><a href="#chat-mode" id="chat-mode">Chat Mode</a></h3>
<div id='66e323c3b49c9e3c9edb6c67'></div>
<p>When <code>Chat Mode</code> is enabled, you're able to have conversations with the AI. You can enter the content of an AI question anywhere onto your tree, and then click the <code>Ask AI</code> button in the node editor to begin a conversation with the AI. The content of your node will be the prompt (question) submitted to the AI, and the AI's response (answer) will be inserted as a subnode underneath that node. In this way all conversations are hierarchical. Every answer is a subnode of a question.</p>
<div id='66e329ebb49c9e3c9edb6c6c'></div>
<p>It may seem slightly more complex to have a conversation exist as a tree structure, than as a flat list (like most Chat Apps have), until you realize that very often you'll need to go back to prior points in a conversation and branch off and take the conversation in a different direction than you originally did. Once you have this need the first time you'll then understand how all conversations (whether with people or AIs) are always best represented as tree structures, and that is of course a foundational element of Quanta's design. It may be a little confusing also at first as to what &quot;branch off in a different direction&quot; even means so here's that this means, in case it's not obvious:</p>
<div id='66e329ebb49c9e3c9edb6c6d'></div>
<p>During any chat conversation the AI will be using all the &quot;parent nodes&quot; (up to where the initial question was asked) as it's entire &quot;context&quot; for the discussion. So if you're having a long discussion with the AI and then you realize you should've said something different or taken the discussion in a different direction than you already have, you can go to any prior location on your conversation thread and submit a <em>different</em> response or question than what you had initially done, and then under this <em>different</em> response you can have an entirely new conversation flow, and the AI will have no &quot;recollection&quot; that you ever went off on the &quot;other direction&quot;, because, as mentioned above, only the parent nodes (from both you and the AI) will exist as the AI's &quot;context&quot; (knowledge) of what has already been said in the conversation.</p>

<p>Before you can start using AI, you need to Configure AI on some node in your account. Any Node can be configured to support AI, and once you configure a node with AI settings, then anywhere under it's subgraph you can post questions using the &quot;Ask AI&quot; button on the node editor.</p>
<p>Use <code>Menu -&gt; AI -&gt; Configure AI</code> to configure a node (any node), so that all questions anywhere on the tree under that node will be answered based on the settings you define.</p>
<p>The image below shows a simple, single sentence, <code>System Prompt</code> that tells the AI that it's a Physics expert helping out with writing tasks. All of these settings are optional except for the 'AI Service' selection.</p>

<h4 id="examples"><a href="#examples" id="examples">Examples</a></h4>
<p>Here are some other example System Prompts to give you an idea of just how flexible and intelligent the AI is at assuming various roles. The <code>System Prompt</code> is where you tell the AI what role it is going to play in the discussion. Here are some more examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are a helpful assistant. <em>(This is the default System Prompt if one is not specified)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will summarize content you are provided with for a second-grade student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be provided with a piece of code, and your task is to explain it in a concise way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be provided with a block of text, and your task is to extract a list of keywords from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will create a Python function from a specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be provided with a sentence in English, and your task is to translate it into French.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will convert natural language into SQL queries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that all these start with <code>You will</code> or <code>You are</code>. This is not required but always makes sense, because what you're doing is describing to the AI how it will be have, and you give those instructions as if you were a person talking to it, instructing it.</p>
<div id='66d7a3927515c33b5c738076'></div>
<h4 id="document-writing-example"><a href="#document-writing-example" id="document-writing-example">Document Writing Example</a></h4>
<p>Assuming we have <code>Menu -&gt; AI -&gt; Mode -&gt; Writing</code> selected, and are writing a document with AI assistance. Here's an example of a more elaborate prompt that could be used for writing technical papers and documents:</p>
<div id='66d7a4037515c33b5c738077'></div>
<p>System Prompt:</p>
<p>You're a world-renowned expert and university professor and researcher in the fields of both Neuroscience and Physics. Your first name is Hal. You're helping me write an academic paper called &quot;Entangled Resonance Theory&quot;. If I refer to you by name (Hal) and ask you to write something specific you will write what I asked for. If I'm not addressing you directly, by name (Hal), you'll assume I'm just giving you a piece of content for you to reword it, as necessary, to make it have the correct tone and style that would be found in an academic paper, without adding any new or different ideas.</p>
<p>To summarize, if I mention your name (Hal) you'll write the content I'm asking for, otherwise if I don't mention your name, you will rewrite the entire prompt as if it was part of our research paper.*</p>
<div id='66d7a43d7515c33b5c738078'></div>
<p>With the above Agent Prompt you can enter something like <code>Hal, describe what Quantum Mechanics is</code>, and click <code>Ask AI</code> and Hal will then insert that content text that you asked for.</p>
<p>On the other hand if you just enter some text you've written yourself and click <code>Ask AI</code> without mentioning Hal at all, then the AI will know it should just rewrite your content text using the professionalism and tone of a research paper.</p>

<h5 id="including-content-in-prompts"><a href="#including-content-in-prompts" id="including-content-in-prompts">Including Content in Prompts</a></h5>
<p>In cases where your System Prompt needs to be very long and involved, and perhaps even have formatted code in it (or markdown), you can embed the content of another node, by using it's Node Name, to embedded into the prompt automatically as a text substitution.</p>
<p>Each node can be assigned a &quot;text name&quot; (inside the Node Editor Dialog). So if for example you have a large amount of text you want to include in one or more System Prompts, you can just give the root Node of all that content a name like &quot;system-prompt-pirate&quot; for example. And then for your System Prompt you could just put <code>::system-prompt-pirate::</code> to embed that node's content into the System Node automatically. Note that we have simply surrounded the Node Name with double colons (<code>::</code>).</p>
<p>So once you've done this then when ever the AI runs it will substitute the entire content of the subgraph (under the 'system-prompt-pirate` node) directly into the System Prompt before sending it to the AI to be used.</p>
<p>All this is doing is letting you optionally use all the content under a node  as a chunk of text substituted into your System Prompt. This substitution can happen at multiple levels, as well, meaning that if the content you're substituting also has it's own <code>double colon</code> named nodes in it, then all those substitutions are carried out as well. So in computer-language parlance this means <code>System Prompts</code> are &quot;composable&quot;. You can build prompts out of chunks of other prompts etc.</p>
<p>This advanced composability of prompts is really only ever needed in very special use cases where perhaps your prompts need to describe different aspects of the computer code for some application, where you can define various software artifacts independently and then include (i.e. mention) these artifacts independently merely by mentioning their node name.</p>

<h5 id="supporting-latex-math"><a href="#supporting-latex-math" id="supporting-latex-math">Supporting LaTex Math</a></h5>
<p>If you're asking for or expecting LaTex math formulas in the AI's output, it's recommended to include a blurb like this in your promot so the AI will generate something guaranteed to display well in markdown:</p>
<p><em>When you use LaTex math always use $$ syntax and put the $$ on a line by itself above and below the LaTex, because that's how my app knows to center it on the page which is what I want.</em></p>
<p>Here's an example of how it the LaTex will look:</p>
<pre><code>$$
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} f(x,t) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} f(x,t) - M^2 f(x,t)
$$
</code></pre>
<p>Which displays as:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} f(x,t) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} f(x,t) - M^2 f(x,t)
$$</p>

<p>The screenshot below shows the easiest way to ask the AI a question. You just type your question and click the <code>Ask GPT</code> button. The answer to the node content will be inserted as a subnode directly under the node containing the question.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_64f9194706a5b22fcf32ed0d_p' src='attachments/64f9194706a5b22fcf32ed0d_p.png'  />
<figcaption>Fig. 36</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='64ebead0c33eef3cdbdac7ed'></div>
<p>You can ask questions to ChatGPT, and it's answer will be saved as a subnode under the question node. This means you can have a more <code>hierarchical</code> way of chatting with the AI, than what most chat systems provide, where any location in this hierarchy has it's own unique &quot;context&quot;.</p>
<div id='66ce018561c5ec64edece157'></div>
<p>By &quot;context&quot; we mean the AI knows exactly what has been previously said during any conversation, and will resume talking to you at any point starting with that specific set of &quot;memories&quot; in it's &quot;mind&quot;.</p>
<div id='66ce018561c5ec64edece158'></div>
<p>In other words, if you're having a conversation (i.e. asking questions) and go back up the tree to a higher location in the conversation thread, and ask a new question under one of those 'nodes', that's like rolling back the mind of the AI to the exact state it had at that point in the conversation; and it will answer the new question based on that state of mind.</p>
<div id='64ec08dbc33eef3cdbdacd3a'></div>
<p>Once you've gotten an answer back from the AI, you can then select the answer node, and create another question node under it using the same process, to continue with the conversation (i.e. asking more questions).</p>
<div id='66ce019361c5ec64edece159'></div>
<p>You can keep asking more follow-up questions as long as you want, and that will just extend the length of that &quot;conversation branch&quot; under the tree. You can of course go back to any location in the tree and ask a different follow-up question and you will get an answer equivalent to if you had rolled-back the &quot;memory&quot; of the AI back to that point in time.</p>
<div id='66ce019361c5ec64edece15a'></div>
<p>This memory of the conversation state is called Hierarchical Contextual Memory (HCM). Stated another way, we could say that the &quot;context&quot; (the AI's memory and understanding of the conversation) for any question always includes all &quot;parent nodes&quot; at higher levels up in the tree, going back to when you asked your original question.</p>

<div id='65b6b269e6d38a174f58684a'></div>
<p>Use <code>Menu -&gt; AI -&gt; Ask about Subgraph</code> to open a text entry box where you can enter a question (to be answered by AI) about the content under the selected branch of the tree. In other words you can select a node that is at the top level of whatever you want to ask questions about, and then click this menu item.</p>
<div id='65b6b269e6d38a174f58684b'></div>
<p>The term <em>subgraph</em>, of course means just &quot;everything under that branch&quot;. All of the text under that subgraph will be used as the context information fed to the AI for it to be able to answer the question with, in addition to all it's built-in knowledge.</p>
<div id='65b6b269e6d38a174f58684c'></div>
<p>If you only want to ask an AI question about a limited subset of nodes you can use the checkboxes on each node (when <code>Edit Mode</code> is enabled) to select one or more nodes and this will cause the subgraph to be filtered to only included your selected nodes as input context to the AI.</p>

<div id='660b43ddb2d57601ed0927db'></div>
<p>Let's say you're writing a research paper, and you want to get AI assistance with your writing, or even let AI do all your writing for you.</p>
<p>In this scenario you would first create the top level &quot;root&quot; of your document on the content tree. You would call it something like &quot;A Unification Theory: Schrodinger Black Holes&quot; or whatever. So all your sections, and paragraphs and content will go under that node as a large subgraph representing your document.</p>
<p>There are only two simple steps to start creating documents using AI assisted writing (or completely AI-Generated) writing, as follows:</p>
<div id='64f7a2a206a5b22fcf329784'></div>
<h3 id="step-1---configure-document-root-node-to-have-ai-settings"><a href="#step-1---configure-document-root-node-to-have-ai-settings" id="step-1---configure-document-root-node-to-have-ai-settings">Step 1 - Configure Document Root Node to have AI Settings</a></h3>
<p>You would then select that document root node and click <code>Menu -&gt; AI -&gt; Configure Agent</code> and enter into that dialog something like shown in the image below:</p>
<p>The above system prompt at the root of the document gives the AI the ability to apply that system prompt across the entire document as you start generating AI content underneath. So you've sort of given this Agent responsibility to help with this entire document.</p>
<figure>

<p>In the AI menu, enable the <code>Writing Mode</code> checkbox. This will make it so that as long as that check box is enabled every node you insert into your content will have a text field where you describe (to the Writing Agent) the content you want to create, and then when you click the <code>Ask AI</code> button at the bottom of the editor you get whatever written content you've requested.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_65d6ed44d711a216791d9551_p' src='attachments/65d6ed44d711a216791d9551_p.png' style='width:50%' />

</figure>
<div id='66a42cc6eb755647390e0c39'></div>
<p>After doing step #1 and #2 above you are now ready to start writing content. Any nodes you create that are tree descendants (i.e. contained under) the root node of your document can be answered by the AI Writing Agent which will act as whatever role you defined for it to do, as your writing assistant.</p>
<p>So here's what we could do to perhaps create a node that describes what Quantum Mechanics is:</p>
<div id='66a479b93035ce3a41d93a75'></div>
<p>Now we can just create a node and ask the AI to generate some content for us as shown in the screenshot below:</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_66a479b93035ce3a41d93a75_p' src='attachments/66a479b93035ce3a41d93a75_p.png' style='width:100%' />
<figcaption>Fig. 39</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='66a479f43035ce3a41d93a78'></div>
<p>That will result in the following being generated and displayed (image below). Notice that for me, as the owner of the node, I can see the prompt that generated the paragraphs of text (as long as <code>Menu -&gt; Options -&gt; Node Info</code> checkbox is set), but no other users will be able to see that prompt.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_66a479f43035ce3a41d93a78_p' src='attachments/66a479f43035ce3a41d93a78_p.png' style='width:100%' />
<figcaption>Fig. 40</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='66a47ac13035ce3a41d93a7b'></div>
<p>Of course now if we open the node again, we see the content that was generated, and if we want to edit that we can, but if we did another <code>Ask AI</code> on the node, rather than just a <code>Save</code> button click, then our edits would get replaced with another full response from the AI. So in Writing Mode be careful with the <code>Ask AI</code> button because you're asking it to replace the current content of the node with it's generated content.</p>

<p>To summarize the above writing process. You can check the <code>Menu -&gt; AI -&gt; Writing Mode</code> checkbox, and that will put the app in a mode where it always displays an <code>AI Query</code> text field at the bottom of the editor where you can tell the AI what content you want it to generate, and it will generate that content for you when you click <code>Ask AI</code>.</p>
<p>You can then edit the generated content yourself if you want or update your AI Query and regenerate another version of what you asked for. You can also of course directly edit the AI generated content to make more your own, if you want.</p>

<div id='66a58aeb675db02956c9efa9'></div>
<p>You can use Quanta to write an entire book, on any topic, for any target audience! Here's the general approach for how the writing and creative process works:</p>
<div id='660b1c29b2d57601ed09274f'></div>
<p>First you'll generate the outline for the book by describing what the book will be about, who the intended readers are, and how long (number of chapters) you want the book to be. Once you provide this very high level information, Quanta will scaffold out a sort of <code>Table of Contents</code> and then automatically generate the root level book node, all the chapter nodes, and all the section (chapter sub-parts) as well.</p>
<div id='660b1d0eb2d57601ed092750'></div>
<p>Once this book structure has been created you can add more chapters or chapter sections at any time, to make the book what you want it to be. Note that if you're composing some kind of Fiction book, the chapters and sections given to you will just be created out of thin air and will be totally unpredictable except for the fact that it's responsive to your summary of what you said you want the book to be about.</p>
<p>However, if you are writing a non-fiction book, about a technical subject, or history, or other factual information, the chapters and subsections that are generated for you will be somewhat predictable because they're coming from facts about the world rather than pure fiction.</p>
<div id='660b1dc3b2d57601ed092751'></div>
<p>After this book scaffolding is created you can then drill down into the hierarchy of any location in the book and create a new node there. The system will detect that you're in an AI Generated book (the details about that detection process will be described later) and when you click the &quot;Ask AI&quot; button in the node editor of your new node, the AI will analyze everything it knows about the book, and what chapter, section, etc. you're creating content under and then write that entire section of the book for you into your node, and save the node.</p>
<div id='660b1e6ab2d57601ed092752'></div>
<p>There are numerous reasons we considered it better to generate the book content &quot;on demand&quot; rather than all at once, which we'll skip for now (but explain below), but be aware that you can customize the content creation as necessary, by asking for whatever book content you'd like to create at any location in the book.</p>
<p>The chapters and sections, and the overall purpose of the book (that you provided when you created the initial scaffolding) will always be taken into account as you auto-generate new paragraphs of content, but you can also customize the content creation instructions, specific to each paragraph, as shown in the actual example steps in the screenshots below.</p>
<div id='660b1f97b2d57601ed092754'></div>

<p>Let's look at the actual steps to create a book about bicycling for adults getting into the sport. The screenshots below show the process of creating this book from scratch and then generating a couple of nodes of content for it, although you could finish the entire book by adding content under each section which only takes a single mouse click to do.</p>
<div id='660b4315b2d57601ed0927d9'></div>
<h4 id="step-by-step-screenshots"><a href="#step-by-step-screenshots" id="step-by-step-screenshots">Step by Step Screenshots</a></h4>
<p>The next 17 screenshots below show you how to create books (i.e. auto-generate content), or other structured texts using AI.</p>
<div id='660b34abb2d57601ed092794'></div>
<p>First we create somewhere to hold our book, and in the image below, as you can see, we'll just put the book in a node we created called <code>My Books</code>. Once we click on <code>My Books</code> to make it the 'selected' node (as you can see by the blue bar on it's left), we can click the menu item called <code>Generate Book</code>.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_660b34abb2d57601ed092794_p' src='attachments/660b34abb2d57601ed092794_p.png' style='width:100%' />
<figcaption>Fig. 42</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='660b34ddb2d57601ed092797'></div>
<p>Next we describe the book we're about to create, in as much detail as we want. You should mention in the description that you're indeed creating a book, what it's about, and who the target audience is. Then click the <code>Generate</code> button.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_660b34ddb2d57601ed092797_p' src='attachments/660b34ddb2d57601ed092797_p.png' style='width:100%' />
<figcaption>Fig. 43</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='660b350ab2d57601ed09279a'></div>
<p>After the <code>Generate</code> button ran a process for a few seconds your book scaffolding (i.e. a book <code>outline</code> or <code>Table of Contents</code>) will have been created. As you can see in the image below we have the top level node representing the entire book, as well as the chapters. We can't see all the chapters without scrolling down of course), but they're there. Also we can expand any of the chapters and see even a further breakdown of each chapter into `sections', and those are there and already generated for us as well!</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_660b350ab2d57601ed09279a_p' src='attachments/660b350ab2d57601ed09279a_p.png' style='width:100%' />
<figcaption>Fig. 44</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='660b353db2d57601ed09279d'></div>
<p>So we expand the <code>Choosing the Right Bicycle</code> chapter to take a look at the sections. Currently the system doesn't allow you to specify the number of 'sections' in each chapter, but you can set the number of chapters, as you saw above. However you can manually add more <code>sections</code> yourself, just by creating a node anywhere you want. Nothing is <code>fixed</code> about this tree of content. It's still all editable by you and nothing is permanent. Quanta is just automatically creating nodes of content for you using AI. You can always manually edit anything that got created, add images, move nodes around, etc.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_660b353db2d57601ed09279d_p' src='attachments/660b353db2d57601ed09279d_p.png' style='width:100%' />
<figcaption>Fig. 45</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='660b3569b2d57601ed0927a3'></div>
<p>Now we've turned &quot;Edit Mode&quot; back on in the screen shot below, and you can see the screen got a little more cluttered with buttons. We now still have <code>Types of Bicycles</code> as the selected node. So we click the <code>+</code> (Plus Button) that's right above the chapter text <code>Types of Bicycles</code> and that inserts a new node, so we can auto-generate that piece of content for the book, at that location in the book.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_660b3569b2d57601ed0927a3_p' src='attachments/660b3569b2d57601ed0927a3_p.png' style='width:100%' />
<figcaption>Fig. 46</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='660b3578b2d57601ed0927a6'></div>
<p>Now before we start editing, we need to go to <code>Menu -&gt; AI -&gt; Writing Mode</code> and be sure that check box is checked. This puts the app in a mode where it allows you to enter a description of what content you want the AI to create for any node, and then it will populate the text content of the node with that when you click <code>Ask AI</code>.</p>
<p><em>Note: Notice this node's AI Query was just entered as &quot;Write the content for this section&quot;, since there's enough context above it for the AI to know how to generate. However we could have also just put &quot;?&quot; as the AI Query, and that would've also worked the same. The AI knows that when you enter &quot;?&quot; you're just asking it to generate new text for your document based on the location in the document.</em></p>
<figure>
<img id='img_660b3578b2d57601ed0927a6_p' src='attachments/660b3578b2d57601ed0927a6_p.png'  />
<figcaption>Fig. 47</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='660b358eb2d57601ed0927a9'></div>
<p>So now we can see the AI has auto-generated content for this location! We can edit this content by hand, if we don't like it. We can also update the specific prompting that generated this text too, and regenerate completely new content to overwrite this content if we want.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_660b358eb2d57601ed0927a9_p' src='attachments/660b358eb2d57601ed0927a9_p.png' style='width:100%' />
<figcaption>Fig. 48</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='660c56934cd11d33319a87a3'></div>
<p>Above we generated book content based on the <code>Book Context</code> at that location (i.e. the Chapter Title, Section Title, etc).</p>
<p>Next let's look at how to generate some very specific content that not only relies on the chapter and section we're in, but is even more specific. In other words we're going to auto-generate content that we describe specifically to the AI, but let the AI actually do the writing for us.</p>
<p>In the image below you can see where we've created a brand new node directly under the <code>Joy of Bicycling</code> chapter itself. Note that <code>AI Query</code> is where we describe to the AI what we want to be generated as the content for this specific node. As you can see, we're asking for a bit of humor about riding with your cat.</p>
<p>So with that AI Query entered we just click <code>Ask AI</code> button, and it will generate the content into this node for us.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_660c56934cd11d33319a87a3_p' src='attachments/660c56934cd11d33319a87a3_p.png'  />
<figcaption>Fig. 49</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='660b36ebb2d57601ed0927d3'></div>
<p>We see the screenshot below after we just now generated using the <code>Ask AI</code> above.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, in the screen shot below we've turned on &quot;Node Info&quot; again and so we can see the AI's new instructions below (i.e. the text starting with &quot;Write a humorous opening remark...&quot;) the content that those instructions created. And again, note that our readers cannot ever see the instructions. Only the author of the content (actually the owner of the node) can see these instructions.</p>
<p>You can then go back into the node and edit the AI instructions again and regenerate if you want, or you could even directly edit what the AI had created as well.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_660b36ebb2d57601ed0927d3_p' src='attachments/660b36ebb2d57601ed0927d3_p.png' style='width:100%' />
<figcaption>Fig. 50</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='660b36fcb2d57601ed0927d6'></div>
<p>Finally, let's go back and look at the larger scale instructions that are in effect during all of our editing of this book. We do this by going to the root level node (the &quot;Book&quot; node), and opening up the <code>AI Config</code> for that root node.</p>
<p>As you can see, the root node (Book Node) has a System Prompt that we never wrote, because it was put there automatically when we first created the Book Scaffolding. This top level (root level) System Prompt is ultimately in control of what happens during all of our <code>Ask AI</code> runs we did above, and you can edit these instructions if you want.</p>
<p>These default instructions were carefully crafted to give the user a good book writing experience, but if you know what you're doing with AI &quot;Prompt Engineering&quot; and you know how &quot;System Prompts&quot; work (primarily using the OpenAI ChatGPT Cloud Service API), then you should be able to edit this content if you need to. Then again, it doesn't really take an engineer either, because you can see it's just giving the AI the larger overall purpose of what it's supposed to be doing so it's fairly obvious how to update that prompt if you think you can improve it, even if you're not an engineer or a rocket scientist.</p>

<h3 id="why-use-book-writing-features"><a href="#why-use-book-writing-features" id="why-use-book-writing-features">Why use Book Writing Features</a></h3>
<p>(If you're not even an author!)</p>
<div id='660b7f9bb2d57601ed0927df'></div>
<p>You may be wondering why you even need any Book Writing features if you're not an author? Well first of all you're not really writing a book anyway, you're just creating structured text. The terminology of Book, Chapter, Section, Subsection is just a convenient metaphor to help you interact with the hierarchy and organization of content. In reality, you may be creating a research paper, a document on some subject, or just learning new material, purely for your own private consumption.</p>
<div id='660b8030b2d57601ed0927e0'></div>
<p>If you went thru the screenshots above and followed what was going on you will also realize that what this &quot;Book Authoring&quot; really is doing is walking you thru the process of researching some new thing you may not know about. Think of requesting a book as a very advanced type of Google Search, where the search results that you get back just happens to be a comprehensive outline of some topic, that you can 'fill in' on demand.</p>
<div id='660b808eb2d57601ed0927e1'></div>
<p>For example, as the developer of Quanta myself (a Java developer) the first book I created was one I got with the instructions: &quot;Create a book on Python programming geared towards expert Java developers who want to learn Python&quot;. It created a very nice outline for the book. Then I just generated each piece of content on demand (similar to what's shown in the lengthy series of screenshots above).</p>
<p>When I came up with various pieces of information I wanted to know about, in that Python book example, I would just create a Chapter or Section for that particular sub-topic and request that the AI auto-generate that content right inline in the book. That's just one example of a <code>book concept</code> and a <code>target audience</code>, but the examples that can be created by LLMs are of course almost infinite.</p>
<div id='660b8183b2d57601ed0927e2'></div>
<p>The fact that you can create your own books is a powerful thing, but what multiplies that power by a factor of 10x or 100x is the fact that you can request any book <code>for any audience</code>. For example, you could request a book in Quantum Mechanics for a Junior High level person. That would be quite an interesting book. And the fact that you can customize your own chapters and sections and make the book quite unique to you, albeit hopefully (if LLMs work correctly) a perfectly factual and useful book for everyone else too.</p>
<div id='660b8249b2d57601ed0927e3'></div>
<p>In summary, the reason the Book Writing feature of Quanta is important to authors and non-authors alike is because it's really a powerful research tool, that ends up creating not just answers to your questions about anything in the world, but also helps you organize your information into a hierarchy that you will find useful years into the future, or that you can potentially share with others.</p>
<p>Remember, there's an &quot;Export to PDF&quot; feature in Quanta too, so if you do want to create something (a book, or document) that's easily shareable outside the Quanta server instance, you can always export it to PDF, and let that be your final product.</p>

<div id='66cbae303d26ec1bae8749c7'></div>
<p>The docker compose file named <code>dc-dev.yaml</code> shows an example of a setup that enables the Coding Agent in the QAI Microservice (which enables the Coding Agent in the Quanta app also). The important parts of that yaml that activate the Coding Agent are 1) the two volumes named <code>/projects</code> and <code>/data</code> in the QAI service configuration, and 2) the variable <code>aiAgentEnabled: &quot;true&quot;</code> that's defined in the Quanta service itself which tells the app to enable the agent. After these two changes the Coding Agent features in the app will become available.</p>
<div id='66ce2aab0843c4114d7be593'></div>
<h3 id="using-the-coding-agent"><a href="#using-the-coding-agent" id="using-the-coding-agent">Using the Coding Agent</a></h3>
<div id='66cbae303d26ec1bae8749c8'></div>
<p>Once you've made these changes to the docker YAML the AI menu in the app will show an <code>Agent Mode</code> checkbox (in addition to the <code>Writing Mode</code> one), which if checked, will let you submit AI prompts to the Coding Agent using the <code>Ask AI</code> button on the Node Editor.</p>
<div id='66cbae303d26ec1bae8749c9'></div>
<p>Also once this is activated you'll see a text field in your AI Settings (<code>Menu -&gt; AI -&gt; Settings</code>) panel which lets you provide a comma delimited list of file extensions to include from the <code>/projects</code> folder scans. These file extensions are how you narrow down what you want the coding agent to see. Normally you would put extensions of code files like py (Python), js (JavaScript), etc.</p>
<div id='66cbae303d26ec1bae8749ca'></div>
<p>Once you've enabled these AI settings mentioned above, any questions you ask to the AI will be assumed to be questions about your codebase (i.e. whatever's in <code>/projects</code> docker volume, per docker YAML) and you can either ask questions about the code or ask for actual refactoring to be done!</p>
<div id='66ce0cf80843c4114d7be58f'></div>
<p>If you ask for refactoring to be done, the Quanta AI agent will actually make those changes directly in your code in real-time, as it answers your questions, or performs what you ask it to do. So the best practice is to be working in a git branch where you can allow the AI to modify your code and then you can use git (or your IDE Git integration/extension, to be more specific) to immediately show you the changes the AI has made which you can then either accept or reject.</p>
<div id='66ce3fdd0843c4114d7be597'></div>
<h4 id="block-syntax"><a href="#block-syntax" id="block-syntax">Block Syntax</a></h4>
<div id='66ce40460843c4114d7be59a'></div>
<p>You can define <code>Named Blocks</code> in your code to identify specific areas which you'd like to ask questions about by name (name of a block), to save you from having to continually paste those sections of code into AI prompts, whenever you need to refer to them.</p>
<p>In other words, this tool will automatically scan your project files and locate named snippets (or sections of code) called <code>blocks</code> (i.e. fragments of files, that you identify using structured comments, described below).</p>
<div id='66ce405d0843c4114d7be59b'></div>
<p>Named blocks are defined using this kind syntax to wrap part of your files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">-- block_begin SQL_Scripts
...some sql scripts...
-- block_end 
</code></pre>
<p>--or--</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// block_begin My_Java
...some source code...
// block_end 
</code></pre>
<p>Currently the only comment characters supported are <code>--</code> (common for SQL files), <code>//</code> (common for Java, JavaScript), and <code>#</code> (for Python files)</p>
<div id='66ce40920843c4114d7be59c'></div>
<p>In the example above, the text that comes after the <code>block_begin</code> is considered the <code>Block Name</code> and, so those blocks, anywhere in your code, can now be referred to as <code>block SQL_Scripts</code> in your prompts to the AI. In other words when you mention &quot;blocks&quot; the AI can understand based on context when you're talking about a &quot;Named Block&quot; of code, and it will know how to find and even edit those blocks of code directly in your source files, wherever they exist.</p>
<div id='66ce42730843c4114d7be5a0'></div>
<p>For example, the following prompt would make sense to the AI: &quot;What are the names of my SQL tables that are in block SQL_Scripts?&quot; In that prompt you're just asking a question about a block. You could also request refactoring by mentioning block names like this: &quot;In block SQL_Scripts add a new table create SQL statement that creates a table named 'people' and has 'first_name' and 'last_name' columns in it.&quot;</p>
<div id='66ce40b20843c4114d7be59d'></div>
<h5 id="block-examples"><a href="#block-examples" id="block-examples">Block Examples</a></h5>
<div id='66ce40d40843c4114d7be59e'></div>
<p>Suppose you have a Java file that contains the following, somewhere (anywhere) in your project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// block_begin Adding_Numbers
int total = a + b;
// block_end
</code></pre>
<p>You can run LLM Prompts/Queries like this:</p>
<pre><code>What is happening in the `Adding_Numbers` block ?
</code></pre>
<p>So you're basically labeling (or naming) specific sections of your code (or other text files) in such a way that this tool can find them, answer questions about them, and/or modify them directly. You can go anywhere in your codebase and wrap sections of code with this <code>block_begin</code> and <code>block_end</code> syntax.</p>
<div id='66ce0c6c0843c4114d7be58e'></div>
<h3 id="creating-custom-coding-agents"><a href="#creating-custom-coding-agents" id="creating-custom-coding-agents">Creating Custom Coding Agents</a></h3>
<div id='66ce2b290843c4114d7be594'></div>
<p>By enabling the <code>Coding Agent</code> features (described above) you'll have access to a general purpose Coding Agent which knows how to do simple refactoring of your project. However, for lots of use cases, it's more convenient to define a specific Agent which focuses on a particular area or aspect of your codebase, so that each time you need to work on that area of the code the Agent already will understand the full context.</p>
<p>For example if your project has SQL and a Database there will be specific files and folders that always need to be the focal point of any refactoring discussions related to the SQL and DB. So here's how you'd configure such an Agent:</p>
<div id='66ce0a8a0843c4114d7be58b'></div>
<p>Here's an example of an AI Agent configured to be an SQL expert for working on a codebase. Note that since we have Coding Agents enabled for the app the additional fields for <code>Folders to Include</code> and <code>File Extensions</code> appear on the AI config panels, so that any Custom Agents you define can be given not just the specific instructions, but they also can be told which files and extensions to include and will ignore any files not on those folders or not matching the provided file extensions.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_66ce0a8a0843c4114d7be58b_p' src='attachments/66ce0a8a0843c4114d7be58b_p.png' style='width:100%' />
<figcaption>Fig. 52</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='66ce11660843c4114d7be591'></div>
<p>To create a <code>Coding Agent</code> like the one above, create a node and enter into it's content text something like <code>SQL Coding Agent</code>. Then select that node and choose <code>Menu -&gt; AI -&gt; Configure Agent</code> which will display the dialog (shown above). Then in this dialog you'll describe an SQL Agent who knows exactly where your SQL-related code is in the project. Once you've done this, your node will be used for all questions asked in sub-branches under it.</p>
<div id='66ce12380843c4114d7be592'></div>
<p>You can then start asking questions or requesting refactoring to be done, and the agent will be active for those questions, as long as you have <code>Menu -&gt; AI -&gt; Agent Mode</code> checkbox selected. This checkbox makes the app assume all your questions are going to an agent and are related to code refactoring.</p>
<p>The way you submit requests (i.e. prompts) to the agent is to create a subnode anywhere under the <code>SQL Coding Agent</code> node (or any node you've configured to be an agent) and enter node content/questions like, for example, &quot;What are the names of our SQL tables?&quot; and then click <code>Ask AI</code> button. The system will notice your question is being asked within a part of the tree under the <code>SQL Coding Agent</code> and will therefore let that specific Agent handle the question, and give you the answer, or do whatever refactoring you've asked for.</p>

<p>Most of the time you'll find it easier to browse the content tree using the <code>Folders Tab</code> where you can only see one section (or subbranch) of the tree at a time. However sometimes it's more convenient to view a branch of the tree as if it were actually a single-page document, and that's what the &quot;Document View&quot; does.</p>

<p>Notice that the above link is just the link to the named node, with <code>?view=doc</code> on the URL to specify that it should be presented like a document.</p>
<div id='63f2d31855770e1b97de0d1a'></div>

<div id='65f739adcb4027493226dd10'></div>
<p>Since the platform data (nodes) is a tree structure, and since replies to content (regardless of whether you're talking to an AI or an actual person) are always created as subnodes under the node being replied to, it can sometimes be easier to interact with the content by switching to a more linear, top-to-bottom, chronological view of a specific conversation thread.</p>
<div id='65f73a78cb4027493226dd11'></div>
<p>This is what the Thread View is designed for. You can switch to the Thread View of any node by clicking the dropdown menu item <code>Thread History</code> on the node. This will display the Thread View which always contains a top-down chronological list of all the ancestor nodes.</p>
<p>Here's what the menu looks like, after you click the <code>&quot;...&quot;</code> icon:</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_65f73a78cb4027493226dd11_p' src='attachments/65f73a78cb4027493226dd11_p.png'  />

<div id='65f73bfdcb4027493226dd12'></div>
<p>Since each node has only one parent node, you can envision the process of walking up the tree node by node, always taking the parent and then the parent above that, etc, repeatedly. This process builds up the 'reply chain' above the node (if the node is part of a conversation), going back to the beginning of the conversation. Then the Thread View displays the entire conversation, from top to bottom.</p>
<div id='65f73cb2cb4027493226dd16'></div>
<h2 id="ai-chat---use-case-for-thread-view"><a href="#ai-chat---use-case-for-thread-view" id="ai-chat---use-case-for-thread-view">AI Chat - Use Case for Thread View</a></h2>
<p>One scenario where the Thread View is very useful is when chatting with AI (Large Language Models). For this reason, any time you ask a question to an AI, the app will automatically switch you over to the Thread View so you can see the entire back and forth conversation thread between you and the AI. You can then ask followup questions by clicking a button at the bottom, similar to how most other AI chat interfaces work.</p>
<p>When doing AI chats in this way, it's also important to know that whatever you see in the Thread View will also be the actual and entire &quot;Conversation Context&quot; that's known to the AI. It knows what you've said previously only based on the specific conversation itself.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the AI Section of this User Guide, you can always jump back over to your Content Tree (Folders Tab), and branch off at any prior location in the past conversation, by asking a different question than you had originally asked. When you branch off like this, the entire tree is persisted of course, but the actual &quot;Context&quot; for the AI Conversation will still be just the sum total of all parents above the node where you ask the question at any time.</p>

<p>Probably the most useful of these is the Top 100 tags, because this gives you a quick way to see a list of what all the hashtags are which are used under any section of the tree.

<div id='64e6970203bc775e03560853'></div>
<p>In the context of the Quanta platform, we have a very specific meaning for the term <code>timeline</code>. A <code>timeline</code> is defined as the reverse-chronological listing of the entire recursive subgraph under any branch of the tree.</p>
<p>In other words a <code>timeline</code> consists of everything (every node) under that branch of the tree presented as a list (not a tree), with the newest on top&quot;. A common abbreviation for this is &quot;rev-chron&quot;.</p>
<div id='64e6977403bc775e03560865'></div>
<h2 id="terminology"><a href="#terminology" id="terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
<p>Although the term 'timeline' has become associated with Social Media feeds in recent years, the term timeline, as used in Quanta, is a more specific feature and just means some rev-chron list, generated by the user 'on demand' similar to a type of 'search results' view.</p>
<p>So you can &quot;View a Timeline&quot; of any node that just means generating this rev-chron, and displaying it in the &quot;Timeline Tab&quot;.</p>
<p>Quanta does have a Social Media Feed, but that's under the 'Feed Tab', and it's not generally referred to as a <code>timeline</code> but is referred to as a <code>feed</code>.</p>

<h2 id="powerful-collaboration"><a href="#powerful-collaboration" id="powerful-collaboration">Powerful Collaboration</a></h2>
<p>Timelines give you a powerful way to find out what the newest content is under any branch of the tree, with a single click. This is extremely useful for collaborative document editing.</p>
<p>Below is an example showing how we can add a node at some random location on an arbitrarily large tree of content (War and Peace, in this case), and then rapidly find it again just by opening a Timeline View of any ancestor node at any level higher up in the tree.</p>
<div id='6287d57896d3696042d5d75a'></div>
<p>Below shows our test node I created to demonstrate how we can find it again using a Timeline View. The node that starts with <code>&quot;I'm adding this node...&quot;</code> (in the image below) was created at a random location just to prove we can easily find it again.</p>
<p>Since this node is the newest (when these screenshots were taken) the newest node should appear at the top of any timeline which would contain it, as we see below.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_6287d57896d3696042d5d75a_p' src='attachments/6287d57896d3696042d5d75a_p.png' style='width:100%' />

</figure>
<div id='6287d6bb96d3696042d5d792'></div>
<p>As expected, the newest node is always at the top of the rev-chron list, so this has found the most recent content, and it's what we just added of course. You'll also notice the app switched over to the <code>Timeline Tab</code>, but we can always go back to the Folders tab any time.</p>
<figure>

<p>We could have also searched from anywhere else on the tree that's still above the node in question, in the hierarchy. So let's do that. We'll go directly to Book 7 and run a Timeline again on Book 7. Since our latest change was indeed somewhere down inside Book 7 as well, we can use Timeline again to find the node again.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_6287d73d96d3696042d5d79c_p' src='attachments/6287d73d96d3696042d5d79c_p.png' style='width:100%' />

<p>If you're working collaboratively with a team on a document (with multiple other people), you can view a timeline to see everyone's latest contributions to the document (or even just a sub-section of the doc), as a rev-chron list. With one click you can also jump from the rev-chron listing (aka. Timeline) to the actual node in the main content tree.</p>
<div id='5fa1926c6b842575d0e925fb'></div>
<p>The Timeline capability is also useful for reading discussion threads and allows you to quickly find all the latest posts in any large social media thread.</p>
<p>This is true because the &quot;reply&quot; button on any node will create a subnode under the node you're replying to, and so this builds up a tree structure that organizes the conversation very well. So the Timeline View is a way to view the tree not as a tree but as a rev-chron list.</p>

<p>Because Quanta supports a real-time (i.e. Live) updates to timeline views, this is what we use to create a <code>Chat Room</code> experience. In other words, now that recent versions of Quanta have a <code>Live</code> option and a <code>Chronological</code> option (as opposed to only Rev-Chron), we can have an identical experience to a Chat Room by selecting the Live option and the Chronological ordering of posts.</p>
<div id='65c129a12fc9703caf57fed8'></div>
<p>Rather than having a <code>Chat Room</code> feature that behaves identically to the <code>Timeline</code> feature, Quanta lets users select the Live option and the node ordering (Chronological or not) independently to customize their experience much better than what most Chat Apps offer. In other words we don't need a specific &quot;Chat Room&quot; feature, because the Timeline feature can already do everything Chat Rooms do, but in a <em>much</em> more powerful and flexible way.</p>
<p>For example if you like to see all the newest content at the top of the page (i.e. view everything in rev-chron order) you can do that, even though it's not possible in most Chat Apps. Also if you don't want the chat window to update in real-time while you're trying to read posts, you can un-check the &quot;Live&quot; checkbox.</p>
<div id='65c12a422fc9703caf57fed9'></div>
<p>So we have this terminology called a &quot;Chat Room&quot; in Quanta, but that's really just a Timeline view, and the app will show &quot;Timeline&quot; at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Another advantage Quanta gets from this &quot;Timeline-based&quot; chat capability is that <strong>any node</strong> can operate as a &quot;Chat Room&quot; because of the fact that anyone who has access to a node can open a &quot;Timeline View&quot; of that node.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-chat-room"><a href="#create-a-chat-room" id="create-a-chat-room">Create a Chat Room</a></h2>
<p>There are two steps required to create a Chat Room experience where you can share the room to other users. First of all remember since a chat room is ultimately a timeline of a node, that node will be the 'root' node for all content in the chat room. In other words, the chat room is composed of an ordered (by time) view of the entire sub-graph under the root node.</p>
<p>Here are the two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Share the node publicly (or to the specific users you want to allow)</li>
<li>Give the node a <code>Name</code>, so you have a user friendly URL to share.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since both of those steps are described in other sections of this document we won't explain those features here.</p>

<h2 id="share-your-chat-room"><a href="#share-your-chat-room" id="share-your-chat-room">Share your Chat Room</a></h2>
<p>Once you've created a node, given it a name, and shared it, you can then share the link with others and they can start adding content under that node (i.e. a Chat Room experience) if you share the URL with them.</p>
<p>To find the URL for the <code>Chat Room</code> that you can share with other users, first select the node itself (by clicking on it) and then click &quot;Links&quot; from the node menu for that node (visible of you've set <code>Menu -&gt; Options -&gt; NodeInfo</code>) and then you can see the link as shown in the image below. It will be the one below <code>Timeline View (By Name)</code>.</p>
<p>If you look at the URL itself you can also see all it's really doing is appending <code>view=timeline</code> to the URL, so that when users go to that node they're immediately presented with it's Timeline View.</p>

<p>To encrypt a node, open the Node Editor, expand the &quot;Advanced&quot; section, and click the Encrypt checkbox. Once that checkbox is checked, the content will be encrypted, on the server, and only you and others you've shared it to will be able to see it. You can still edit the node, and every time you save the node it gets re-encrypted again.</p>
<p>The padlock icon will show up on the node to let you know it's encrypted.</p>
<div id='5fa1926c6b842575d0e92628'></div>
<p>You can visually verify that your data is being encrypted by selecting the encrypted node and using <code>Menu -&gt; Info -&gt; Show Raw Data</code>. The content property of the node will be the unreadable hexadecimal of the encrypted data, and this encrypted data is what's stored on the server. The server never sees the unencrypted text, so even in the event of a server security breach/hack, none of the encrypted data can ever be exposed.</p>
<div id='5f1795da33fee84d9aa76242'></div>
<h2 id="technical-notes"><a href="#technical-notes" id="technical-notes">Technical Notes</a></h2>
<p>The browser's built-in JavaScript Crypto API and RSA PKE (Public Key Encryption) is used. We use the industry-standard PKE scheme where neither the private key nor the un-encrypted text ever leaves the browser. This is commonly called &quot;End-to-End&quot; (E2E) encryption.</p>
<div id='62734cc9eecc41560f845118'></div>
<h2 id="encryption-strategy"><a href="#encryption-strategy" id="encryption-strategy">Encryption Strategy</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>The following (below) is how the encryption scheme works. As an end user you don't need to know any of this, but for developers to understand the design we included this explanation.</p>
<p>First of all, this is the standard industry approach. This was not an algorithm invented by or specific to Quanta, but is just the basic PublicKey technique used by most systems that do E2E Secure Messaging.</p>
<div id='63ee5ebe4975b001996fd72b'></div>
<p>Example scenario:</p>
<p>Let's say Alice has a secret message to share with two other users, Bob and Cory. All Alice has to do is check the 'Encrypt' checkbox in the editor and then add Bob and Cory using the sharing dialog.</p>
<p>What happens, technically, in the database is the following: When the node is encrypted the system generates a random encryption key (a Symmetric AES Key) just for that node so that only that key can decrypt the data. So then the question becomes how to make it so that ONLY Bob and Cory can ever be able to get that key to the data.</p>
<p>This is where Asymmetric (PublicKey) Encryption comes in. What Quanta automatically does is it encrypts the 'key' with Bob's PublicKey to get 'bobsKey' and then encrypts the key again with Cory's PublicKey to get 'corysKey' and attaches both bobsKey and corysKey onto the node. Both of those can be completely public.</p>
<p>So now when either Cory or Bob view that node, they, and only they, can use each of their Private Keys to decrypt the key to the data. Once they can decrypt the key to the data they can then see the data, but only them and no one else.</p>
<p>Also this all happens automatically. Both Bob's browser and Cory's browser automatically recognize they have the key to the data, and everything is done automatically to allow them to read the message. None of the parties involved had to do anything &quot;manually&quot; with keys.</p>
<p>In case that was confusing here's the gist of the tricky parts: When data is encrypted with a PublicKey of a keypair then only the PrivateKey (of that keypair) can decrypt that data. And the inverse is also true. When the PrivateKey encrypts some data then only the matching PublicKey can decrypt the data. Based on this logic people can securely communicate encrypted data without a need to secretly send 'passwords' to each other. This entier strategy is what's commonly referred to as &quot;Public Key Encrytion&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="key-management"><a href="#key-management" id="key-management">Key Management</a></h2>
<p>todo: Docs below need to be updated because the new Security Keys Dialog is a slightly different process than what's described below:</p>
<div id='5fa1926c6b842575d0e9262a'></div>
<p>As an end user, you don't normally need to worry about security keys. Your browser will automatically generate your PKE security key for you. Your browser always has one single PKE key-pair (created by Quanta) that's for Quanta encryption, decryption, and identifying you.</p>
<div id='5fa1926c6b842575d0e9262b'></div>
<p>However if you're dealing with important data, you will want to save your key info out of the browser and into some safe location in case you ever need to reinstall your browser, or reinstall your OS or for whatever other reason. To do this there's an &quot;Encrypt&quot; menu that lets you view your keys, generate new keys, re-publish your public key, or import a saved copy of your keys.</p>
<div id='5fa1926c6b842575d0e9262c'></div>
<p>Warning: If you use the <code>Encrypt -&gt; Generate Keys</code> that means you want to intentionally throw away your old keys. So, unless you've saved them in a text file yourself (by copying out of the 'Show Keys' dialog), then you'll never be able to decrypt any of the data that you had encrypted with the old keys.</p>
<p>So don't use the Generate Keys function unless you know what you're doing, or know you don't have any encrypted data you might be about to loose access to because you didn't already export your currently existing keys.</p>
<div id='5fa1926c6b842575d0e9262d'></div>
<p>For this reason it's a good idea to save the content of the 'Show Keys' dialog into a text file just in case you do accidentally run &quot;Generate Keys&quot; and overwrite your keys. If you have your keys saved you can put them back in with 'Import Keys' and once again get access to any data encrypted with those keys, at any point in the future. Just remember never to share the &quot;Private Key&quot; section of that text because whoever has that can decrypt your data and/or potentially masquerade as you.</p>
<div id='605e4ac72a5f6c6bdbaf7b93'></div>
<p>Caveat/Warning: If user 'A' encrypts a node and then shares with user 'B', this will work, and user 'B' can see the decrypted content unless/until user 'B' regenerates his security keys, using <code>Encrypt -&gt; Generate Keys</code> menu item. After user 'B' regenerates his keys, user 'A' will have to open the shared (encrypted) node and click 'Save' again, in order for 'B' to continue being able to read the content.</p>
<p>This is a minor limitation, and will be made easier to use in a future release of the app.</p>

<h3 id="html"><a href="#html" id="html">HTML</a></h3>
<p>Creates a single HTML file containing the content of the subgraph of the exported node. This HTML file along with all the image files and other attachments are packaged into the archive file so that when you expand the archive file you can then view the HTML file offline in your browser.</p>
<div id='6570f021fc3f094a7cc062c9'></div>
<h3 id="markdown"><a href="#markdown" id="markdown">Markdown</a></h3>
<p>Exporting to Markdown exports the content pretty much verbatim as it's stored in the cloud database, because the app uses Markdown as it's primary editing format. Your exported content will be merged into a single markdown file in the exported archive. Image attachments will all go into a folder named 'attachments' in the archive, and the markdown content will display those images inline.</p>
<div id='6570efbdfc3f094a7cc06285'></div>
<h3 id="json"><a href="#json" id="json">JSON</a></h3>
<p>If you want to export content as a way of doing a backup (that can later be restored/imported) select the JSON format. A JSON format will contain all the actual raw data content from the nodes. The other file export types (Markdown and HTML) are primarily for creating browsable offline copies of the data.</p>

<h3 id="files-and-folders"><a href="#files-and-folders" id="files-and-folders">Files and Folders</a></h3>
<p>Exports an archive file that's the best way to browse your tree directly on your file system after extracting the files and folders. You will end up with a folder structure where each node is a folder, and you'll have a <code>content.md</code> file in each folder that is the content of the nodes. The folder names are auto-generated as readable text based on the first line of content in each node. The main purpose of this kind of export is so that you can create usable backups that allow you to browse your data completely without the use of the Quanta App.</p>
<p>This export feature also provides a good path of egress if you should decide after using Quanta that you want to stop using Quanta and move all your data out into files and folders.</p>

<p>If there are one or more nodes you don't want included in your export, you can add a property named <code>noexport</code> to the node and give it any value like '1'. This will basically truncate that entire branch of the tree from the export and none of the subnodes under that Branch will be exported .</p>

<p>None of the private keys on your browser are ever sent to the server, and it's up to you to back them up in a safe location to be sure you have the ability to always decrypt any of your encrypted messages.</p>
<p>Currently the only way to backup keys is to copy the text out of this dialog box, and then they can be reimported back in using this dialog box also.</p>

<p>The Encryption Keys Dialog lets you manage your cryptographic key used for encrypting your own nodes and/or accessing encrypted nodes that are shared to you from other users.</p>
<p>The <code>Publish Public Key</code> button let's you ensure the server has the current key from the browser, which it will need in order to let you securely share content, but this is normally not needed and should happen automatically without you clicking the button.</p>
<p>The <code>Import Key</code> lets you update the Selected Key type, from text content that you can paste in. This text content will be something you had previously gotten just by selecting the key JSON shown in the dialog. So there's no <code>Export Key</code> feature currently and you have to just cut-and-paste the JSON yourself. This process will be made easier in a future version of the app.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-web-basics"><a href="#semantic-web-basics" id="semantic-web-basics">Semantic Web Basics</a></h2>
<p>The <code>Semantic Web</code> is a set of standards that allow data on the web to have specific <code>Data Types</code> (i.e. Objects with Properties), so that computers can automatically parse and understand the data. The goal of the <code>Semantic Web</code> is to make internet data machine-readable.</p>
<p>A simple example use of a Type would be the <code>&quot;Person&quot;</code> Type. In normal non-Semantic Web content, when you have a person's name in some content it might be just a line of text like <code>&quot;Leonard Nimoy&quot;</code> and to a computer that just looks like two words. Obviously, excluding AI, of course, the meaning of each word is not understood by machines.</p>
<p>However, with the Semantic Web we have Objects with Properties. So in the Semantic Web version of a person object it would be represented in some way where it's properties are known like this:</p>
<p><code>Person:</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-js">{
    familyName: &quot;Nemoy&quot;
    givenName: &quot;Leonard&quot;
}

<p>This document is a <code>User Guide</code> rather than a <code>Technical Guide</code>, but nonetheless it's insightful to show just how easy it was to get the above editor and display working without writing any special computer code.</p>
<p>In other words all of the Editor Layouts and Display Formats in the images above were created automatically by Quanta just by analyzing the Schema.org data type info, plus just one additional block of configuration information, in the form of a simple <code>YAML Format</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">props:
  Person:
    givenName:
      label: &quot;First Name&quot;
      width: 40

<h3 id="about-the-yaml"><a href="#about-the-yaml" id="about-the-yaml">About the YAML</a></h3>
<p>As you can see, the above YAML config is simple but it's all Quanta needs to be able to present a nicely formatted display of information, as well as an Object editor that works without a programmer having to write code for each type.</p>
<p>Here's what's happening, in the YAML above: As you can see the &quot;Person&quot; object must match one of the Schema.org types.</p>
<p>Then we list below it all the properties that we want to use, and the order we want them displayed and edited in. The display uses that ordering and the width values (which are percent widths), to auto-construct an editor by arranging the display of properties across the view panel from left to right and top to bottom. Also the label let's us give a more friendly text label to display for each field (i.e. property).</p>
<p>So in summary, once this tiny bit of config YAML is created for any of the Schema.org types we want to use, we instantly get a GUI that does everything we're doing in the above images, and as said, it happens automatically without any custom coding!</p>

<h3 id="full-schema-org-support"><a href="#full-schema-org-support" id="full-schema-org-support">Full Schema_org Support</a></h3>
<p>Even though the above example for the <code>Person Object</code> has that specific YAML file we just saw, be aware that it was still optional to write that special YAML. Even if we add none of our own YAML configs for any of the types we can still use <code>any of the other 100s of other types</code> that exist in Schema.org, because Quanta supports all of them by default.</p>
<p>So to clarify, the only reason we <strong>did</strong> add a specific YAML object config for the <code>Person Object</code> (above) was to get the specific desired <code>page and editor layout</code>. Without that specific YAML config the Person Object would still work just fine, but the properties editor and display of the person would've been ugly because the properties would've been in simple alphabetical order and displayed arranged vertically, rather than the nice looking layout form our YAML defined.</p>

<h3 id="non-schema-org-properties"><a href="#non-schema-org-properties" id="non-schema-org-properties">Non-Schema_org Properties</a></h3>
<p>Arbitrary <code>Key/Value</code> pairs can also be added to any node including properties that are not part of schema.org. In the example below we have added <code>'prop1', 'prop2', and 'prop3'</code> to demonstrate this.</p>
<p>Those properties could've been named anything, and they could've been assigned any values we want.</p>

<h2 id="node-linking"><a href="#node-linking" id="node-linking">Node Linking</a></h2>
<p>The term <code>RDF Triple</code> is the technical name for a very simple concept, which in the context of Quanta means you're linking two nodes together with a <code>Predicate</code>. The simplest (and the default) predicate can just be the word <code>link</code> itself, to indicate the relationship between two nodes is that one links to the other. Indeed the way nodes can be <code>linked</code> is to use an <code>RDF Triple</code>.</p>
<div id='65bbdbeecf425c5fe6f2ddcf'></div>
<p>The images below show the basic concept of an RDF Tripe. It's called a <code>triple</code> because you have a Subject, Predicate, and Object. However in Quanta you can think of these as a <code>Source Node</code>, verb, and <code>Object Node</code>.</p>

<p>Under <code>Menu -&gt; RDF Triple</code> menu item is where you will find the RDF Triple options. To link two nodes together, use the following four step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the node you want to be the <code>Subject</code></li>
<li>Click <code>Menu -&gt; RDF Triple -&gt; Set Subject</code></li>
<li>Click on the node you want to be the <code>Object</code></li>
<li>Click <code>Menu -&gt; RDF Triple -&gt; Create Triple</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>Create Triple</code> function will ask you to enter the <code>Predicate</code> but you can just enter <code>link</code> for that, if you're just making an arbitrary link between the two nodes, with no particular predate relationship.</p>
<p>That's it! Once you've linked the nodes then the <code>Subject</code> node will always display the links (predicates) on the page, that you can click on to jump to the <code>Object</code> node.</p>
<div id='65be7c46cf425c5fe6f2de07'></div>
<h3 id="create-triple"><a href="#create-triple" id="create-triple">Create Triple</a></h3>
<p>The <code>Create Triple</code> function mentioned above leads to the following dialog where you can enter the Triple Information. The default Predicate is always <code>link</code> so that your association is a link from one node to another, but as stated above you can change that to some other word/relationship.</p>
<p>The <code>Embed Content</code> option can be selected if you want to actually also <strong>display</strong> the linked node content right inline on the page just below the node that links to it. You can access <code>RDF Link</code> dialog from the Node Editor dialog as well to change the predicate configuration any time, or delete it.</p>

<p>In the menu above you saw <code>Menu -&gt; RDF Triple -&gt; Find Subjects</code>. This menu can be used to do the reverse of jumping from a Subject to an Object node. When you click a node to highlight it, and it's the Object of one ore more <code>RDF Triples</code> you can use the <code>Find Subjects</code> function to find all the places that link to that Object node (i.e. all the nodes that are participating in an RDF Triple using the selected node as the subject)</p>

<p>You can also link nodes using the Drag and Drop feature. Whenever you drag a node over another node, and do the mouse Drop gesture, you will be presented with the <code>RDF Link</code> dialog shown above, and in this way you can link two nodes by dragging one node over the other.</p>
<p><em>Tip: The <code>History Panel</code> (lower right section of page) can be used both as a drag gesture source, and drag gesture target, for node linking or any other Drag and Drop initiated function.</em></p>

<p>You can optionally display <code>RDF Links</code> on node graphs using the controls at the top right of the Graph Display window.

<div id='673be3c7f0c42c7fc61e4269'></div>
<h2 id="about-hashtags"><a href="#about-hashtags" id="about-hashtags">About Hashtags</a></h2>
<p>As with most other Social Media and/or wiki platforms, you can enter hashtags directly into your content text as needed. A hashtag is of course just a word with a hashmark <code>#</code> in front of it.</p>
<div id='673bca4df0c42c7fc61e4243'></div>
<p>These hashtags can then be searched for, which is the main reason for using them. Quanta however goes a step further by, in addition to this, having an ability to associate one or more hashtags onto any node in a way that's not required to be embedded into the content text.</p>
<div id='673bca91f0c42c7fc61e4244'></div>
<p>Hashtags of this kind (i.e. not in the content text) will instead display below the node separate from the content. You can still search for these kinds of hashtags using the search feature, but they're easier to edit and delete when they're not embedded in the content text and they will only be visible if you have <code>Menu -&gt; Options -&gt; Node Info</code> selected.</p>
<div id='673bcb15f0c42c7fc61e4245'></div>
<h2 id="adding-hashtags-to-a-node"><a href="#adding-hashtags-to-a-node" id="adding-hashtags-to-a-node">Adding Hashtags to a Node</a></h2>
<p>You can also pre-define various hashtags or groups of hashtags so you can rapidly pick from them when editing nodes, so let's look at a example of that first. Suppose we want to invent a system that has <code>#todo</code> as a hashtag and also <code>#complete</code> and <code>#incomplete</code> as a basic todo app categorization.</p>
<p>First we create a new node, and click the &quot;Tags&quot; button at the bottom as shown here:</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_673bcb15f0c42c7fc61e4245_p' src='attachments/673bcb15f0c42c7fc61e4245_p.png'  />
<figcaption>Fig. 107</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='673bdadef0c42c7fc61e4253'></div>
<p>Now we'll be looking at the <strong>Add Hashtags Dialog</strong>, and we can see we have three already defined but we want to define some new ones and put them under a heading to make them grouped, so we click <strong>Edit Tags</strong> button.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_673bdadef0c42c7fc61e4253_p' src='attachments/673bdadef0c42c7fc61e4253_p.png'  />

<div id='673bdb2cf0c42c7fc61e4256'></div>
<h2 id="pre-defining-hashtags"><a href="#pre-defining-hashtags" id="pre-defining-hashtags">Pre-Defining Hashtags</a></h2>
<p>We'll now be in the <strong>Edit Hashtags Dialog</strong> where we can define whatever we want our hashtags to be. This is kind of like our library of available hashtags, and this is an ordinary multi-line text field we can enter them into. Note that any lines of text that aren't hashtags are assumed to be descriptive text, so we have a line at the top as <strong>TODOs</strong> with our todos hashtags below it. We now click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_673bdb2cf0c42c7fc61e4256_p' src='attachments/673bdb2cf0c42c7fc61e4256_p.png'  />
<figcaption>Fig. 109</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='673bdb51f0c42c7fc61e4259'></div>
<p>After clicking &quot;Save&quot; in our Tags editing dialog we'll now be back at the <strong>Add Hashtags</strong> again but now can see it's changed, and contains the new tags for us to choose from, so we select a couple of tags and click <strong>Ok</strong></p>
<figure>
<img id='img_673bdb51f0c42c7fc61e4259_p' src='attachments/673bdb51f0c42c7fc61e4259_p.png'  />
<figcaption>Fig. 110</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='673bdb7ff0c42c7fc61e425c'></div>
<p>Now we'll be back at our Node Editor Dialog and we can see it showing the two hashtags that have been set for this node. Of course the next time we need to add tags we won't have to define the tags again we'll just be able to pick them from the list again, as shown in the <em>Search</em> example next.</p>
<figure>

<h2 id="searching-hashtags"><a href="#searching-hashtags" id="searching-hashtags">Searching Hashtags</a></h2>
<p>One of the main reasons you'd ever assign hashtags to a node is of course for searching purposes, so you can find things later based on tags categories. So as you'll see if we open the <strong>Search Dialog</strong> it has a <strong>Hashtags Button</strong> on it.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_673bdb98f0c42c7fc61e425f_p' src='attachments/673bdb98f0c42c7fc61e425f_p.png'  />
<figcaption>Fig. 112</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='673bdbb0f0c42c7fc61e4262'></div>
<p>So after clicking the Hashtags button on the Search Dialog it opens the Tags picker dialog again, and we can pick something to search for, like <code>#todo</code>, and then click <strong>Ok Button</strong></p>
<figure>
<img id='img_673bdbb0f0c42c7fc61e4262_p' src='attachments/673bdbb0f0c42c7fc61e4262_p.png'  />
<figcaption>Fig. 113</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='673bdbd2f0c42c7fc61e4265'></div>
<p>So that added the hashtag to our search, automatically surrounding in quotes which is required and important. Special characters like the pound sign (<code>#</code>) aren't considered an important part of the search text unless quoted so that's why we need quotes.</p>
<p>If we click <strong>Search</strong> now that would find all the nodes that have the <code>#todo</code> hashtag.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_673bdbd2f0c42c7fc61e4265_p' src='attachments/673bdbd2f0c42c7fc61e4265_p.png'  />
<figcaption>Fig. 114</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='673bdfc2f0c42c7fc61e4268'></div>
<p>NOTE: Most of the above was all about showing how we can pre-define hashtags for consistent use and for easy picking both for attaching them onto nodes and for searching for them, but of course directly entering hashtags into the content text works fine too.</p>
<p>For hashtags you use often, or need to be consistent with, it makes sense to pre-define them, but for one-off use cases of unique hashtags you can just enter them directly,.</p>
<div id='673e44a2f0c42c7fc61e427f'></div>
<h1 id="calendar"><a href="#calendar" id="calendar">Calendar</a></h1>
<div id='673ec040aa53a12b272f593f'></div>
<p>Whenever a node has been assigned a 'date' property it will be able to appear on the Graphical Calendar View and various other calendar-related list views. To make it easy to add a date property, there's a button on the Node Editor just for adding the data property, in a single click.</p>
<div id='673f9605aa53a12b272f594b'></div>
<p>As an example suppose we have created the node in the image below. The button to rapidly turn this node into a calendar due date is highlighted in yellow.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_673f9605aa53a12b272f594b_p' src='attachments/673f9605aa53a12b272f594b_p.png'  />
<figcaption>Fig. 115</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='673f9668aa53a12b272f594e'></div>
<p>After clicking the button we now see that the 'date' property has been added to the node, initialized with the current time, and also the &quot;due&quot; tag has been assigned making this an item that's considered to have this as it's due date. You can click the &quot;due&quot; tag to remove it, if you didn't intend for this item to ever come due, which would be rare.</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_673f9668aa53a12b272f594e_p' src='attachments/673f9668aa53a12b272f594e_p.png'  />
<figcaption>Fig. 116</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id='673f972caa53a12b272f5952'></div>
<p>Once you have one or more calendar items (i.e. any nodes with a 'date' property assigned), you can then use the <code>Menu -&gt; View -&gt; Calendar: ...</code> menu items at any tree level above them to collect just the contained calendar items and present them.</p>
<p>Here's what that menu looks like:</p>
<figure>
<img id='img_673f972caa53a12b272f5952_p' src='attachments/673f972caa53a12b272f5952_p.png'  />

<h2 id="calendar-menu-options"><a href="#calendar-menu-options" id="calendar-menu-options">Calendar Menu Options</a></h2>
<p>Below is a description of what each of these Calendar Menu items will do.</p>
<p>It's important to know the content of these Views will contain only the calendar items contained in the subgraph of your currently selected tree node. This subgraph approach is very powerful because if you only want specific sections of your node tree to represent specific kinds of calendar items this is easy to do. In other words, if you want to separate out different work projects into different branches you can view those calendars separately.</p>
<p>Of course, if you want to see all your calendar items (i.e. all nodes containing a 'date' property) merged into one consolidated view or calendar display you can select your account root, and these Views will contain all calendar items you have, regardless of tree location.</p>
<div id='673f97e7aa53a12b272f5956'></div>
<h3 id="display"><a href="#display" id="display">Display</a></h3>
<p>Shows a graphical Calendar view (image below). You can click to add new nodes directly from this calendar view, as well as edit or delete any of the nodes that appear. When you click items the full Edit Node Dialog opens right on top of the Calendar View while you edit them, so you never need to leave the Calendar View while editing calendar items.</p>

<p>System Prompt:You are an expert automobile mechanic and will diagnose and trouble shoot problems about cars that you are asked. Assume all questions are about cars.</p>
<p>How do I jump start a dead battery, using jumper cables and a good battery in another car.</p>
<div id='64ec3921c33eef3cdbdad30b'></div>
<p>To jump-start a dead battery using jumper cables and a good battery in another car, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Park the car with the good battery next to the car with the dead battery, ensuring both vehicles are turned off.</li>
<li>Locate the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals on both batteries. They are usually labeled with red for positive and black for negative.</li>
<li>Take the red jumper cable and attach one end to the positive terminal of the dead battery.</li>
<li>Connect the other end of the red cable to the positive terminal of the good battery.</li>
<li>Take the black jumper cable and attach one end to the negative terminal of the good battery.</li>
<li>Attach the other end of the black cable to an unpainted metal surface on the engine block of the car with the dead battery. This is the grounding point.</li>
<li>Start the car with the good battery and let it run for a few minutes to charge the dead battery.</li>
<li>Attempt to start the car with the dead battery. If it starts, let it run for a while to allow the battery to recharge.</li>
<li>Once the car with the dead battery is running, carefully disconnect the jumper cables in the reverse order: negative from the grounding point, negative from the good battery, positive from the good battery, and finally positive from the dead battery.</li>
<li>Drive the car with the previously dead battery for at least 20 minutes to ensure the battery is sufficiently charged.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's important to note that if the dead battery doesn't hold a charge or the car doesn't start after jump-starting, there may be an underlying issue with the battery or the vehicle's charging system. In such cases, it's advisable to have a professional mechanic inspect the car.</p>

<p>System Prompt:You are a software developer helping me learn git commands for linux.</p>
<p>how do I create a new branch and switch to that branch?</p>
<div id='64ec31d4c33eef3cdbdad219'></div>
<p>To create a new branch and switch to it in Git, you can use the following commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Creating a new branch:</strong></p>
<pre><code>git branch [branch_name]
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>[branch_name]</code> with the desired name for your new branch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Switching to the new branch:</strong></p>
<pre><code>git checkout [branch_name]
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>[branch_name]</code> with the name of the branch you want to switch to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can use a single command to create and switch to a new branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b [branch_name]
</code></pre>
<p>Again, replace <code>[branch_name]</code> with the desired name for your new branch.</p>
<p>Here's an example workflow:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch my-new-branch     // Create a new branch called &quot;my-new-branch&quot;
$ git checkout my-new-branch   // Switch to the newly created branch
</code></pre>
<p>Remember to make sure you are in the correct directory within your Linux system when executing these commands.</p>

<p>create a Java method to call ChatGPT HTTP API using spring RestTemplate</p>
<div id='64ec11abc33eef3cdbdace99'></div>
<p>Sure! Here's an example of a Java method that uses Spring's RestTemplate to call the ChatGPT HTTP API:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import org.springframework.http.HttpEntity;
import org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders;
import org.springframework.http.HttpMethod;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

public class ChatGPTAPIClient {

    private static final String API_URL = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions&quot;;
    private static final String API_KEY = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot;;

    public String getChatCompletion(String message) {
        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

        HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
        headers.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
        headers.set(&quot;Authorization&quot;, &quot;Bearer &quot; + API_KEY);

        ChatGPTRequest request = new ChatGPTRequest(message);

        HttpEntity&lt;ChatGPTRequest&gt; entity = new HttpEntity&lt;&gt;(request, headers);

        ResponseEntity&lt;ChatGPTResponse&gt; response = restTemplate.exchange(API_URL, HttpMethod.POST, entity, ChatGPTResponse.class);

        if (response.getStatusCode().is2xxSuccessful()) {
            ChatGPTResponse responseBody = response.getBody();
            if (responseBody != null &amp;&amp; responseBody.getChoices() != null &amp;&amp; !responseBody.getChoices().isEmpty()) {
                return responseBody.getChoices().get(0).getText();
            }
        }

        return null;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChatGPTAPIClient client = new ChatGPTAPIClient();
        String message = &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;;
        String chatCompletion = client.getChatCompletion(message);
        System.out.println(chatCompletion);
    }

    private static class ChatGPTRequest {
        private String prompt;

        public ChatGPTRequest(String prompt) {
            this.prompt = prompt;
        }

        public String getPrompt() {
            return prompt;
        }

        public void setPrompt(String prompt) {
            this.prompt = prompt;
        }
    }

    private static class ChatGPTResponse {
        private List&lt;Choice&gt; choices;

        public List&lt;Choice&gt; getChoices() {
            return choices;
        }

        public void setChoices(List&lt;Choice&gt; choices) {
            this.choices = choices;
        }
    }

    private static class Choice {
        private String text;

        public String getText() {
            return text;
        }

        public void setText(String text) {
            this.text = text;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to replace <code>&quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot;</code> with your actual API key. In this example, the <code>getChatCompletion</code> method takes a <code>message</code> as input and returns the completion generated by the ChatGPT API.</p>
<p>Note: This code is a basic example and may need modifications based on your specific requirements or any specific response structure from the ChatGPT API.</p>

<p>Create a Java function that takes an array of integers as an argument, and returns the average of the numbers in the array.</p>
<div id='64ebed61c33eef3cdbdac845'></div>
<p>Sure! Here is a Java function that calculates the average of an array of integers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static double calculateAverage(int[] numbers) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int number : numbers) {
        sum += number;
    }
    return (double) sum / numbers.length;
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this function, we iterate through the array using a for-each loop and accumulate the sum of all the numbers. Finally, we divide the sum by the length of the array to calculate the average. Note that we cast the sum to a double to ensure the result is a decimal value.</p>
<p>You can call this function by passing an array of integers as an argument, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] numbers = { 5, 10, 15, 20 };
double average = calculateAverage(numbers);
System.out.println(&quot;The average is: &quot; + average);
</code></pre>
<p>This will output:</p>
<pre><code>The average is: 12.5
</code></pre>

<p>If I see any bears on the trails should I just walk up and feed them an apple right out of my bare hands. No pun intended.</p>
<div id='64ec3b33c33eef3cdbdad345'></div>
<p>No, it is not safe to approach bears or attempt to feed them, even with an apple. Bears in the wild should be observed from a safe distance, typically at least 150 feet away. Feeding bears can habituate them to humans and lead to dangerous behaviors. It's important to remember that bears are wild animals and should be respected as such. If you encounter a bear on the trails, it's recommended to back away slowly, make yourself appear larger, speak calmly, and give the bear space to move away. It's always best to follow any guidelines or recommendations provided by park rangers or authorities in the area.</p>

<p>I think that's good advice. By the way did you understand the &quot;pun&quot; I made earlier. Can you explain the pun to me.</p>
<div id='64ec3bb1c33eef3cdbdad360'></div>
<p>Yes, I understood the pun you made earlier. The pun was a play on words, using the term &quot;bare hands&quot; in the context of feeding bears, which sounds similar to &quot;bear hands.&quot; It was a clever wordplay, and you mentioned &quot;no pun intended&quot; to indicate that you didn't mean to make the pun, although it was intended humorously. Puns often rely on words with multiple meanings or similar sounds to create a humorous effect.</p>

<p><strong>Mathmatics</strong></p>
<div id='64ec4122c33eef3cdbdad41a'></div>
<p>System Prompt:You are a mathematician answering questions by providing the mathematical formula to accomplish what is asked.</p>
<p>Suppose I have a point in 2-dimensional space with coordinates (x1,y1). I would like to rotate that point around another point (x2,y2) by an amount in degrees we will call D. In other words, D is the number of degrees of counter-clockwise rotation. Give me the formulas for that transformation. There should be two formulas, one for the x coordinate and one for the y coordinate.</p>
<div id='64ec42e8c33eef3cdbdad446'></div>
<p>To rotate a point (x1, y1) around another point (x2, y2) by an angle D degrees counterclockwise, you can use the following formulas:</p>
<p>x' = (x1 - x2) * cos(D) - (y1 - y2) * sin(D) + x2</p>
<p>y' = (x1 - x2) * sin(D) + (y1 - y2) * cos(D) + y2</p>
<p>In these formulas, (x', y') represents the coordinates of the rotated point. The angle D is measured in radians, so make sure to convert it from degrees to radians before using the formulas. The functions cos(D) and sin(D) give you the cosine and sine values of the angle D, respectively.</p>
