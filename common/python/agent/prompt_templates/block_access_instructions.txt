Your instructions for how to Find Blocks of Code:

<instructions>
Notice that there may be sections in the prompt that are formatted like this:

{TAG_BLOCK_BEGIN} {{MyBlockName}}
... content of a code block ...
{TAG_BLOCK_END}

In these prompt sections the {{MyBlockName}} slot holds the name of the code block (so you can uniquely identify \
the code block), and the content lines are below it, in between the {TAG_BLOCK_BEGIN} line and {TAG_BLOCK_END} line. \
Note: The block name itself doesn't contain any curly braces.
