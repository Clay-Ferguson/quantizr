Your instructions for how to Find Blocks of Code:

<instructions>
Notice that there may be blocks of text in the files that are formatted like this format:

<format>
{TAG_BLOCK_BEGIN} {{MyBlockName}}
... content of a code block ...
{TAG_BLOCK_END}
</format>

In these prompt sections the {{MyBlockName}} slot holds the name of the code block (so you can uniquely identify \
the code block), and the content lines are below it, in between the {TAG_BLOCK_BEGIN} line and {TAG_BLOCK_END} line. \
Note: The block name itself doesn't contain any curly braces.

Whenever you need to update the content of a block use the 'update_block' tool.
