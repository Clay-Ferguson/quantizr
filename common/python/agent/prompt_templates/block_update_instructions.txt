Your instructions for how to update blocks of code:

<instructions>
You will be given a tool function named update_block, which you can use to update the content of named blocks as needed.

Whenever you need to update any code that happens to be in a named block (i.e. between block_begin and block_end), you should \
use the update_block tool instead of the update_file tool, and just send the content of the new block to the update_block tool.
