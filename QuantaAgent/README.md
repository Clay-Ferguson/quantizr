# About Quanta Agent 

A tool to automate querying AIs (LLMs) about your codebase, which can also automatically refactor your actual project files, from high level human language instructions of what changes you'd like to make. You can ask the tool anything about your project, ask for any kind of refactoring you'd like to do in your project, or even ask the tool to create entirely new projects all on it's own.

You have the option to use either the **Streamlit-based Web Interface/GUI, or a Command Line** version that reads the prompt from a simple text file.

You're probably a developer if you're even reading this so be sure to check out the [Developer Notes](./docs/developer-notes.md)

# Tool Features

* Answers questions about software projects
* Refactor files or entire projects 
* Answers questions specifically about named blocks of your code
* Create new Software Projects based on a description/prompt.

# Project Summary

* Has Streamlit GUI, as well as Command Line version
* Written 100% in Python
* Open Source Python (MIT License)
* Uses Python Langchain giving you flexibility in which LLM you use, including either locally hosted LLMs or Cloud AI Services.

*Note: Current codebase only includes OpenAI ChatGPT, and Anthropic Claud connectivity, but with Langchain it's easy to add support for the other Cloud AIs or Local LLMS.*

If you're a software developer and you want to be able to ask AI (like OpenAI's ChatGPT for example) questions about your code, this tool helps do that. This tool can also implement entire complex features in your code base, by updating existing entire files, or by updating only specific labeled `Named Bocks`, discussed below, to add code to specific locations in specific files as directed by you. 

To ask questions about or request refactorings inside specific files or folders, you simply refer to them by name in your prompt using the following syntax (*folders must end with a slash*):

For Files: `file(/my/file.py)`
For Foders: `folder(/my/project/folder/)`

The location in your prompt where you mention files, or folders, or Block Names (explained later), will be automatically replaced with the actual full content fo those files when the prompt is submitted.

You can mention specific files and/or folders in your prompt to request AI to make modifications directly to those files and make arbitrary code refactorings that you ask for in your prompt! 


# Tool Usage

## To Run

* Streamlit Web App `./run_streamlit.sh`

## Configuration

To use this tool, follow these steps:

1) Edit the `config.yaml` to make it point to a software project folder you want to analyze.
2) Put your `OpenAI API Key` in the `config.yaml` (or command line, or env var)
3) Create an empty `data` folder where your output files will go (also in `config.yaml`)
4) Run the Streamlit-based Web interface with this command: `streamlit run Quanta_Agent.py`, and just use the app like a chatbot or and agent which can do code refactoring just like an expert software developer!

*Tip: When requesting project refactorings, it's best to be in a clean project version, so that if you don't like the changes the tool made to your code you can roll them back easily, using `git`.


# Example 1. Trivial Refactoring

The simplest possible refactoring prompt would be something like this:

```txt
Modify the following Python file, so that it's using a class that has a public static `run` method to do what it does.

file(/temperature_convert.py)
```

In the above prompt we're using the `file()` syntax to inject the entire `temperature_convert.py` file into the prompt, and the tool will actually *do* what you're asking for to the actual file when you run the tool! In other words this tool will modify your source files if you ask for a refactor. The default `config.yaml` already points to the `test_project` folder, which contains a `temperature_convert.py` which is not implemented as a class. So running the prompt example above will update the actual python file and make it into a class as the prompt requested.


# Comparison to other AI Coding Assistants

* Q: How does `Quanta Agent` compare to other `AI Coding Assistants` like Devin, Pythagora (GPT Pilot), and MetaGPT?
* A: `Quanta Agent` allows a more targeted and specific analysis on your software project than the other tools, which results in less API token consumption and therefore lowers Cloud API costs. This is because `Quanta Agent` will only be able to see the parts of your code that you're referencing in your prompt, and it will only try to make modifications in those areas of the code. So not only is `Quanta Agent` very cheap due to using fewer API tokens, but you will also get the best possible results from LLMs by keeping your prompts down to where they contain only the relevant parts of your codebase. That is, smaller shorter prompts always give the best results. 


# More Examples

## Example 2: Ask Question about a Named Block

Suppose you have a Java file that contains the following, somewhere (anywhere) in your project:

```java
// block_begin Adding_Numbers
int total = a + b;
// block_end
```

You can run LLM Prompts/Queries like this:

    What is happening in the following code:

    block(Adding_Numbers)

So you're basically labeling (or naming) specific sections of your code (or other text files) in such a way that this tool can find them, answer questions about them, and/or modify them directly. You can go anywhere in your codebase and wrap sections of code with this `block_begin` and `block_end` syntax, to create named blocks which are then template substituded automatically into your prompt. Also once the AI has seen any code with the named block in it, it can also automatically refactor any of that code for you, and in any number of named blocks, simultaneously.


# Output Log Files

Every time you run an LLM query the full prompt, system prompt, and answer will be automatically saved into a new log file in the `data` folder.

Example log files can be found in this project's [Data Folder](/data)


# Background and Inspiration

There are other coding assistants like Github's Copilot for example, which let you ask arbitrary questions about your codebase, and those tools are very useful. However `Quanta Agent` lets you ask AI questions (i.e. build prompts) in a more flexible, targeted, specific, and repeatable way. `Quanta Agent` can solve more complex and difficult questions, in a repeatable way that doesn't require lots of developer time spent in building the same (or similar) prompts over and over again, by cutting and pasting code into prompts.

For example, let's say you have some SQL in your project and some Java Entity beans that go along with your database tables. You might want to alter or add SQL tables and/or automatically create the associated Java Entity beans. To get the tool to do this for you, in a way that "fits into" your specific application's architecture perfectly, you would want to create prompts that show examples of how you're doing each of these types of artifacts (the SQL and the Java), by wrapping an example in a `Named Block`, and then ask the AI to generate new code following that pattern. 

`Quanta Agent` helps you build these kinds of complex prompts, and keeps developers from having to construct these prompts manually, because you can simply surround the relevant pieces and parts of code related to a specific type of application artifact (like your Java Beans, your SQL, etc), and then write prompts that reference those sections by name. This is what `Named Blocks` are for.

Also since Quanta Agent is based on Langchain, it keeps you from being tied to or dependent upon any specific Cloud AI provider, and gives you the option to run local LLMs for it's use as well.


# Use Cases

## Code Generation

You can use `Named Blocks` to give specific examples of how your software project architecture does various different things, and then ask the AI to create new objects, code, features, SQL, or anything else that follows the examples from your own app, so it's much easier to get AI to generate code for you that's fine tuned just for your specific code base.

## Finding Bugs or Getting Recommendations

You can specify `Named Blocks` or entire files, in your prompt, and then ask the AI to simply make recommendations of improvements or find bugs.

## New Employee Training

If you annotate specific sections (or blocks) of your company's codebase with these kinds of named blocks, then you can write prompts that are constructed to ask questions about a set of `blocks` that will be super informative to new employees learning the codebase, and be able to get answers to questions about that code.

## Adding new Features or Refactoring Code

One very hard part about adding new features to most codebases is remembering all the different locations in the codebase that might need to be altered in order to get the new feature working. Because every app is a little bit different, a tool like this is really the only way to have prompts that are good enough to make complex changes, that would otherwise require a true AGI. 

For example, if you need to add a new feature, it might require a new Button on the GUI, new POJOs, new SQL, new API calls, etc. With a tool like `Quanta Agent` you can package up a prompt that grabs from all these various parts of a codebase to show the AI an example of how one feature is done, just including precisely only the relevant chunks of code, and then do a prompt like `"Using all the example code as your architectural example to follow, create a new feature that does ${feature_description}."` So the context for all the aforementioned example code would just be built using the code chunks from various snippets all around the codebase.

## Code Reviews

Developer teams can theoretically use a standard where (perhaps only temporarily) specific block names are required to be put in the code around all changes or specific types of changes. Then you can use AI to run various kinds of automated code reviews, security audits, code correctness audits; or even just get AI suggestions for improvement that specifically look at all the parts of the code involved in any bug fix or new feature that has been implemented and identified using `Named Blocks`.
