/**
 * This class intentionally creates a deadlock and using LockEx the deadlock is
 * detected. The way it works is this flow:
 * 
 * Thread 1 gets lock a, then waits a second and tries to get lock b, but by then Thread 2 will have obtained lock b and then also be making
 * an attempt to get lock a. This condition will never resolve itself, if they continue waiting, but the purpose of LockEx is that it can 
 * detect there's a deadlock probably happening, and log a warning about it.
 * 
 * This test case verifies a deadlock DID happen and then eventually the following code in LockEx.java does run and breaks
 * the deadlock and then allowes the JUnit test to complete:
 * 
 *    if (abortWhenDeadlockSuspected) {
 *		throw new RuntimeEx("Aborting. Thread "+Thread.currentThread().getName()+" was hung waiting for lock "+lockName+" which was held by thread "+getOwner().getName());
 *	}
