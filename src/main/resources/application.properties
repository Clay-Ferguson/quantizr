# WARNING: The server.servlet.session.timeout is referenced directly

# WARNING: Using MINUTES is required here too!!! (because we have java code expecting that)

# WARNING: Setting this to less than 2m will NOT work well because we start warning user at a 
# minute BEFORE a timeout, so that means only timeouts ">= 3m" can work well in this app.
