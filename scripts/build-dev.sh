# If you're running this before you've ever built the app you need to uncomment the
# install-node-and-npm and npm-install sections in the pom.xml so that NPM itself gets installed
# and all the packages get installed before your first run, then unless you add more dependencies
# without doing a manual 'npm install' yourself (from the correct folder!, with packages.json) you can
# keep those two POM sections permanently commented out so DEV builds run as fast as possible.
